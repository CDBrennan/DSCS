This is the repository for the code used in the Dark Sun Campaign Setting homebrewery project. Both sets of data will need to be imported into Homebrewery- one into the style editor, the other into the brew editor. 

Homebrewery's display differs from computer to computer. I had to do all my formatting work on the same computer, because using my second would mess everything up. So be warned, this will not display correctly out of the box. You will need to edit and reformat things to make it look right on your screen. I'm sorry, but I do not know any way to fix that problem ahead of time.
