# Introduction
The DARK SUN roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, DARK SUN is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the heat-hazed desert beneath a blood-red sun and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.

 {{width:7px}} In the DARK SUN game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a ruined city, a rioting arena, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to a ruined city, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?

{{descriptive
##### 
 {{width:7px}} **Dungeon Master (DM)**: After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and the ruins of Yaramuke stetch out before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep ravine below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance, perhaps a trade route when the city still lived. The ropes of the drawbridge sway with the wind, their silt-caked fibers straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. 

**Phillip (playing Gareth)**: I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues.

**Amy (playing Riva)**: The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we  can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?
}}


 {{width:7px}}  Unlike a game of make-believe, DARK SUN gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' actions. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience. 
 
Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, DARK SUN is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.

{{descriptive
#####
 {{width:7px}} **Dungeon Master (DM)**: OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re looking at the gargoyles?

**Phillip**: Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?

**DM**: Make an Intelligence check.

**Phillip**: Does my Investigation skill apply?

**DM**: Sure!

**Phillip (rolling a d20)**: Ugh. Seven.

**DM**: They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge? Make a Wisdom check, and apply your Perception skill.

**Amy (playing Riva)**: Sixteen! 

**DM**: Many of the drawbridge's planks have rotted through- you both can pass over, but you'll have to do so one at a time or risk falling. 
 }}



The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a campaign. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.

There’s no winning and losing in the DARK SUN game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

## Using this Book

As described in the Table of Contents, this rulebook is divided into seven sections. 

**The World of Dark Sun** is a short Introduction to the DARK SUN campaign setting, which takes place on the strange and barren world of Athas.

**Part 1** is about Creating a Character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in Part 1 rely on material in Parts 2-4. 

**Part 2** details the Rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.

**Part 3** is all about Magic. It covers the nature of magic in the world of Athas, including rules for defilement and preservation (more on that later). Here you'll find all there is to know about the different types of magic, the rules for how to use them, and a selection of spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game. 

**Part 4** describes Psionics, a vital component of the DARK SUN setting. Much like Part 4, here you will find all there is to know about the different kinds of psionics, the rules for how to use them, and a selection of psionic abilities available to psionic characters (and monsters) in the game. 

**Appendix A** goes deeper into the unique cosmology of the DARK SUN setting, detailing the various planes that interact with Athas. 

**Appendix B** gives more information on the Sorcerer-Kings and their cities, including forbidden lore largely lost to time. 

## How to Play

The play of the DARK SUN game unfolds according to this basic pattern.

**1. The DM describes the environment.** The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).

**2. The players describe what they want to do.** Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions. 

\column

 {{width:7px}} Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.

**3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions.** Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.

This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.

Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens  to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.


### Game Dice

The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. 

In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).

Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit. 

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eightsided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.

The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)

\page


### The D20

Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a klar or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the bandit believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a silt estuary? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or do they take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the DARK SUN game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.

Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six **ability scores**. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the **ability modifiers** derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.

**1. Roll the die and add a modifier.** Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See Chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)

**2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.** A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.

**3. Compare the total to a target number.** If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.

The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).

This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in DARK SUN play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.

\column

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in Chapter 7.

### Specific Beats General
This book contains rules, especially in Parts 2-4, that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don’t have proficiency with the exotic gythka, but every Thri-kreen does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.

### Round Down
There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

## Adventures

The DARK SUN game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.

The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master, found whole elsewhere, or tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.

Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try to do next.

Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.

But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.

\column

### The Three Pillars of Adventure

Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.

**Exploration** includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.

**Social interaction** features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the bandit lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from a Templar, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers.

The rules in Chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in Chapter 3 and personality traits in Chapter 4.

**Combat**, the focus of Chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a DARK SUN session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.

# The World of Dark Sun


	
	
{{note
##### Athas
“I live in a world of fire and sand. The crimson sun scorches the life from anything that crawls or flies, and storms of sand scour the foliage from the barren ground. This is a land of blood and dust, where tribes of feral elves sweep out of the salt plains to plunder lonely caravans, mysterious singing winds call travelers to slow suffocation in the Sea of Silt, and selfish kings squander their subjects’ lives building gaudy palaces and garish tombs. This bleak wasteland is Athas, and it is my home.”
	
—**The Wanderer’s Journal**
}}


	

Beneath a crimson sun lie wastelands of majestic desolation and cities of cruel splendor, where sandal clad heroes battle ancient sorcery and terrible monsters. This is Athas, the world of the DARK SUN campaign setting, a dying planet of savagery and desolation. Life hangs by a thread in this barren land. It is unforgiving to the weak, unfair to the strong, and now it is up to you to write your own story in blood and glory.

## Seven Tenets of Athas

### 1. The world is a barren desert

From the first moments of dawn until the last twinkling of dusk, the crimson sun shimmers in the olive-tinged sky like a fiery puddle of blood. It climbs toward its zenith and the temperature rises relentlessly: 100 degrees by midmorning, 110 at noon, 130 - sometimes even 150 - by late afternoon. A person cannot drink fast enough to replenish the fluids they lose. As the days drag on, they feel sick and feeble. If they do not have enough water, they grow too weak to move. Their mouth becomes dry and bitter, their lips, tongue, and throat grow swollen. Before long, their blood is thick and gummy. Their heart must work hard to circulate it. Finally their system overheats, leaving them dead and alone in the sands. 

There are no rivers or lakes in Athas, and pockets of civilization are concentrated around isolated oases where water is more precious than life. Metal is rare; mail or plate armor exists only in the treasuries of these city-states' tyrannical Sorcerer-Kings, and steel blades are things of myth. Mills and workshops are forced to use tools of wood and stone, ceramic tokens serve as currency, and adventurers must forge their equipment from the bones and hide of fearsome predators.

Yet past all these trials, lies great treasure. Ancient ruins sleep beneath the sands, testament to a time before the desert, and the majestic excesses of the Sorcerer-Kings make for many marvels. On Athas, life is a trophy to be won, every soul shining all the brighter beneath the brutality of its dark sun.


### 2. Civilization is savage

Life on Athas is brutal and short. Bloodthirsty raiders, greedy slavers, and hordes of merciless beasts overrun the deserts and wastelands. The cities are not much safer; each choke in the grip of an immortal tyrant. Slavery is widespread on Athas, and many unfortunates spend their lives in chains, toiling for brutal taskmasters. 

Every year, hundreds of slaves, perhaps thousands, are sent to their deaths in bloody arena spectacles. Charity, compassion, kindness—these qualities exist, but they are rare, precious blooms amid ash. Only a fool hopes for such riches.

### 3. Arcane magic defiles the world

Reckless use of arcane magic during ancient wars reduced Athas to a wasteland. To cast an arcane spell, a magic user siphons power from the living world. Nearby plants wither to ash, crippling pain wracks animals and people, and the soil is permanently sterilized. It is possible to cast spells with care in a practice called preserving, avoiding any more damage to the world, but defiling is far faster and easier. As a result, spellcasters are reviled and persecuted across Athas regardless of whether they preserve or defile. Only the most powerful can use arcane abilities without fear of reprisal.


### 4. There are no Gods, only Kings

Athas is a world without deities, cut off from the Outer Planes. Old shrines and crumbling temples lie amid ancient ruins, their pantheons forgotten to the sands, hinting at a time when unknown agents spoke to the people of Athas. Those who lay claim to clerical powers do so through worship of the elements themselves: the sun, the sand, the storm, and the rarest of all, water. 

There are, however, the Sorcerer-Kings. Terrible Defilers of unspeakable power who rule over the ashes of the world they burned, by all appearances the only divinity left to Athas. These mighty sovereigns have held their thrones for centuries, and none alive remember a time before their reign. Some are brutal oppressors, claiming godhood- others are more subtle in their tyranny, governing through draconian bureaucracy. All enforce their will through legions of Crusaders and Templars, peons of the Sorcerer-Kings given a fraction of their sovereign's power in exchange for unwavering loyalty to the Sorcerer-King's dominion. 

### 5. A World of Psionics
	
Another power exists on Athas, untouched by the elements or the arcane- psionics, the power of the mind. Psionics draws only upon the user's inner power, a psychic force Athasians call "the Will" which exists in almost all living things. 


{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

 {{width:7px}} Unlike arcane  magic and the Defilers who wield it, psionics is not feared by society. Instead, it has become a vital tool for survival in the unforgiving world of Athas. For some, psionics can even be a pathway to social advancement, offering power to even the lowliest beggar or slave. 
  
  Most sapient beings in Athas are considered "wild talents", capable of only a single parlor trick or innate talent with their psionics. A rare few have advanced beyond the natural talents they were born with to become full-fledged psionicists, sometimes called mindbenders. These people refine their Will through a practice they call "the Way", honing body, mind, and spirit into a unified core which they refer to as their nexus. From this immense force of will, a psionicist can give form and purpose to their psionic abilities. While the Will makes the use of psionics possible, only through the Way can a person truly master the powers of their mind.

### 6. The sights are strange

Athas has its own deadly ecology. Many creatures that are familiar sights on milder worlds have long since died out  on Athas. The world has no cattle, swine, or horses; instead, people tend flocks of erdlus, ride on kanks or crodlus, and draw wagons with inixes and mekillots. Wild creatures such as lions, bears, and wolves are almost nonexistent. 

In their place are terrors such as the id fiend, the baazrag, and the tembo. Perhaps the harsh environment of Athas breeds creatures tough and vicious enough to survive it, or perhaps the touch of ancient sorcery has poisoned the wellsprings of life and inflicted monster after monster on the dying world. Either way, the deserts are perilous, and only a fool or a lunatic travels them alone.



### 7. Familiar races and classes aren't what you expect

Typical fantasy stereotypes don't apply to Athasian heroes. In many fantasy settings, elves are wise, benevolent forest-dwellers who guard their homelands from intrusions of evil. On Athas, Elvhen are nomadic herders, reviled and hostile to all who wander the wastes they call home. Halflings aren't amiable river-folk; they're Seedlings, xenophobic headhunters who offer corpses as sustenance to their mountain jungles. New races also thrive here: the monstrous Tarek, dim echoes of their giant ancestors, the insectoid Thri-kreen, hive-minded and alien, and the oppressed, ever-underestimated Dul. 

So too for the adventurers of Athas. Warlocks do not make deals for their own ambitions; they submit to Sorcerer-Kings as Templars, upholding tyrannical regimes in exchange for scraps of power. Clerics and Paladins are unrecognizable in a world of silent gods, would-be artificers are stamped out by the constant struggle for resources, and Bards serve as spies and assassins in a world where magic would only turn audiences against them.

{{descriptive
##### Player Tip
The DARK SUN setting isn't a place for your typical bearded dwarf with a love of beer and gems, cherubic halfling, or charging knights and gnome wizards. In this setting, some races don't exist, and the dwarf might instead be a hairless devotee to the sun, the halfling a carnivorous plant-thing, and any wizard likely hides her spellcasting lest a mob hang her for defiling what precious life clings to the earth. Tareks and Thri-kreen are part of the dominant races, and the scarcity of metal leads crafters to creative uses of alternative materials and an entirely different economy. This book expands your usual options and will help you and your friends create characters uniquely invested in this world.
 
 Athas waits to challenge you. Whether you are a Dul gladiator, competing for the cheers of thousands, an Elvhen trickster selling contraband goods as part of your cover for the Veiled Alliance, or a Thri-kreen hunter enthralled by the irregular behaviors of humanoids, you will face the same basic question: are you here simply to survive, or do you dare to do more?
}}

{{note
##### The Call
“Athas is an endless wasteland, yet it has a majestic and stark beauty. When first light casts its emerald hues over the Sea of Silt, or when sunset spreads its orange flame over the Mekillot Mountains, the world’s feral beauty stirs the untamed heart in each of us. It is a call to take up spear and dagger, to flee the cities, to go and see what lurks out in
the barrenness.”

<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### 1. Choose a race
This rulebook provides the racial traits and roleplay aspects of the thirteen available races: Aarakocra, Changelings, Dwarves, Dray, Dul, Elvhen, Humans, Leonin, Minotaurs, Seedlings, Tareks, Thri-kreen, and Ukoven.

</div>

<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### 2. Choose a class
The classes of Athas are: Arcanist, Barbarian, Cleric, Crusader, Druid, Fighter, Empath, Icon, Monk, Nomad, Psion, Rogue, and Templar. The traditional classes and archetypes have largely been modified to fit the setting of Athas, and some classes such as Artificer, Bard, and Sorcerer do not exist.

</div>

<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### 3. Determine ability scores
Roll 4d6 six times and subtract the lowest die from each roll, then assign the results to each of your Ability Scores as you like. If you do not roll at least two 15s, reroll the entire set. Standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or point buy are also permitted.
</div>

<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### 4. Forge your identity
Determine the nuances of your character with additional options- backgrounds, feats, and, unique to the world of Athas, Wild Talents. In this section you will put the finishing touches on your character's core mechanics, and begin to further develop their story and personality. 




</div>

\column


<div style='margin-top:120px;'></div>

<div class='descriptive'>

##### 5. Describe your character
* Determine your character's alignment and how they came by the training required for their abilities.
* Literacy is banned in cities, so consult the DM when choosing a background as to whether your social class enables your character to read and write. 
* Be descriptive! A character is more than numbers. Come up with a personality traits and use the Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws to assist with creating a unique character that will evolve and grow as the campaign grows.
* Consider finding Dark Sun-themed art for your character. The art of the original setting provided enhancement to the setting.

</div>

<div style='margin-top:25px;'></div>
	
	
<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### 6. Choose equipment
Consult the Equipment section in Chapter 5 for purchases, currency, and changes in material. Because of the rarity of metal and water, the economy and gear of Athas has developed quite differently from other settings. For example, the primary currency is a "ceramic token (ct)," not a gold piece, which is far more valuable on Athas.

</div>



<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### 7. Come Together
Most campaigns begin with a unifying starting hook or story. The DM is encouraged to run a Session Zero and/or a Prologue Session, in which players should bring a character concept to the table and utilize that session to finish making characters as a group. The group is encouraged to roleplay how they arrived at their current situation with one another, and work together in developing a narrative that may affect your choice of assigning scores, features, and background to your character.

# Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters

Your first step in playing an adventurer in the DARK SUN game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as Human or Elvhen) and a class (such as Fighter or Nomad). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the DARK SUN world.

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous Fighter, a skulking Rogue, a fervent Cleric, or a flamboyant Arcanist. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny Rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a Templar sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring Dwarves or Elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the Fighter class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see what catches your interest.

Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.

Throughout this chapter, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official DARK SUN character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.

#### Building Bruenor
Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his Dwarf character, Bruenor.

<br>

## 1. Choose a Race
Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent species in Athas. The most common player character races are Humans, Dul, Elvhen, Dwarves, and Thri-kreen. Some races also have subraces, such as the Dray or Ukoven. Chapter 2 provides more information about these races.

The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of Leonin make them exceptional Barbarians, and Elvhen tend to be powerful Rogues. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Tarek Empaths and Dul Arcanists, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.

Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.

Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.

#### Building Bruenor, Step 1
Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff, hyperfocused Dwarf fits the character he wants to play. He notes all the racial traits of Dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.

## 2. Choose a Class
Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents they possess, and the tactics they are most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in Chapter 3.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class features—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.

#### Level
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring, accomplishing great deeds, and otherwise gaining experience. A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although they might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. Depending on the story being told, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher level- if so, be sure to record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st.


{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page


#### Hit Points and Hit Dice
Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your **hit point maximum**. 

Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in Chapter 7).  



#### Proficiency Bonus
The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:
  
• Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient in
  
• Attack rolls with spells you cast

• Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in

• Ability checks using tools you’re proficient in

• Saving throws you’re proficient in

• Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)

Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in Chapter 6, tools in Chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.

#### Building Bruenor, Step 2
Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a Fighter and notes the Fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet.

As a 1st-level Fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10— and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.

## 3.Roll Ability Scores
Much of what your character does in the game depends on their six abilities: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.

The six abilities and their uses are described in Chapter 6. The Ability Score Summary table on the next page provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability and what classes consider each ability particularly important.

Typically, you generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice (4d6) and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this six times, once for each ability. You can also use the Standard Array scores of 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 or a variant method called point buy, detailed below. 

Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each score.


#### Point Buy
You have 27 points total to spend across your six ability scores. The cost of each score is 1 per point above 8, with a maximum of 15 and a minimum of 8 before applying racial increases. For example, a score of 10 would cost 2 points, and a score of 15 would cost 9 points. 


#### Building Bruenor, Step 3
Bob decides to use the standard array for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a Fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bob decides he wants the Dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits by increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and then choosing between the secondary options of Strength and Wisdom (he chooses Strength for +1), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: 

{{column-count:2
- Strength 16 (+3)
- Dexterity 10 (+0)
- Constitution 16 (+3) 
- Intelligence 8 (–1)
- Wisdom 13 (+1) 
- Charisma 12 (+1)
}}
Bob then fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.

## 4. Detail Your Character
Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh them out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what they looks like and how they behave in general terms.

Using the information in Chapter 4, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s **alignment** (the moral compass that guides their decisions) and **ideals**. Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called **bonds**, and the **flaws** that could one day undermine them.

Your character’s **background** describes where they came from, their original occupation, and the character’s place in the world of Athas. Your DM might offer to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept than those included in this book.

A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.

In DARK SUN, there's one more aspect to choose for your character before you're finished- **wild talents**. For the people of Athas, psionics are special because it’s the one source of extraordinary power that does not make them beholden to someone or something else. Templars need a Sorcerer-King. Clerics must pray to the elements. Arcanists leech life from what little is left. Soldiers need someone to make and maintain armaments. And yet, nearly everyone on Athas possesses some minor psionic ability called a Wild Talent, requiring nothing but their own willpower. Consult the Wild Talents section of Chapter 4 to choose yours.

#### Your Character’s Abilities

Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out their appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

{{column-count:2
 {{width:7px}} For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.
:
 {{width:7px}} A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.
:
 {{width:7px}} A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.

\column

 {{width:7px}} A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.
:
 {{width:7px}} A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.
:
 {{width:7px}} A character with high Charisma exudes confidence,  mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

#### Building Bruenor, Step 4

Bob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a dim wit.

Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but his family became banshees after failing in their focus to reclaim a dwarven ruin when Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a leatherworker in the city of Tyr. But Bruenor has a heroic destiny—to finish what his family started—so Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.

Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality in mind, so he notes that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He also chooses the ideal of fairness, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law.

Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his ancestral homeland. His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even when it might not be warranted.

Lastly, Bruenor determines the Wild Talent he begins with. Bob rolls a d20 and gets a 4, which after consulting the Wild Talents table on page 216, tells him he has the ability to Sense Danger, giving him immunity to surprise attacks. Bruenor will never be caught unaware as his family was. 

## 5. Choose Equipment
Your class and background determine your character’s starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in Chapter 5: Equipment.

Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of ceramic tokens (ct) to spend based on your class, as shown in Chapter 5. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the Trinkets table at the end of Chapter 5). Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight exceeding your Strength score times 15. Chapter 7 has more details on carrying capacity.

#### Armor Class
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.

Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + their Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in Chapter 6. Record your AC on your character sheet.

Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in Chapter 6.

Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.

#### Weapons
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.

• For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.

• For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.

####  Building Bruenor, Step 5
Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter class and the folk hero background. His starting equipment includes so-ut mail and a shield, which combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.

For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a rock maul and a dejada stone-thrower. His maul is a melee weapon, so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The maul deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 2d6 + 3 bludgeoning damage. When throwing a pelota stone using his dejada, Bruenor has the same attack bonus (dejada, as thrown weapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), so he deals 1d6 + 3 bludgeoning damage when it hits.

## 6. Come Together
Each character plays a role within a war party, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your war party’s chances to survive the many perils of Athas. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.

# Beyond 1st Level

As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, they gain experience, represented by certain milestones within their adventures or personal arcs where they advance in their capabiltiies. This advancement is called **gaining a level**.

When your character gains a level, their class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.

\column

 {{width:7px}} Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level as a Fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

Consult the information in your character’s class description to see what their proficiency bonus is and other improvements you gain at each level.


{{wide
### Tiers of Play
Within the game are four loosely defined tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels.
:
 {{width:7px}} In the first tier (levels 1–4), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as an Arcanist’s Arcane Mastery or a Fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages. 
:
 {{width:7px}} In the second tier (levels 5–10), characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as *fireball* and *lightning bolt*. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten entire city-states.
:
 {{width:7px}} In the third tier (levels 11–16), characters have reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole regions. 
:
 {{width:7px}} At the fourth tier (levels 17–20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. They may even begin processes of metamorphosis, becoming elementals, avangions, perhaps even a force to rival the Dragon himself. The fate of the world or even the fundamental order of Athas might hang in the balance during their adventures.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<div style='margin-top:50px;'></div>


The Races of Athas come in many shapes and sizes, most very different than other fantasy settings. Certain races are extremely rare to non-existent in certain regions. 

\column

<div style='margin-top:64px;'></div>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Your DM may determine that such races will require deeper consideration and additional background knowledge given to the player, dependent on their place in Athas.

{{classTable,frame,decoration,wide
##### Races of Athas
| Races | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
|  Aarakocra  | A race of avian humanoids living high in the mountains. Rarely found in the Tablelands. |
|  Changeling  | Offspring of human-elf pairings, often unnoticed until they develop shapeshifting abilities in adolescence. Cast into the wastes, they prize self-reliance and hold a special connection with beasts.|
|  Dray  | A secluded race said to come from the lost city-state of Guistenal, few outside the Dray tribes have ever seen these draconic beings or know the difference between their first and second generations.|
|  Dul  | Offspring of human-dwarf pairings, a rare combination gaining the best of both parents. The Sorcerer-Kings use them for slave labor and arena entertainment, crafting whole hordes from cursed flesh-forges. Dul are rare to see outside of the slave pits, and are always sterile.  |
|  Dwarf  | Short, stocky, and hairless humanoids whose unbending and unrelenting focus drives them ever forward. Uncommon in the city-states but present in many outside villages.|
|  Elvhen  | Lanky and long-limbed, Elvhen lives revolve around running with their tribes and resisting the rule of the Sorcerer-Kings. Traders, raiders, and nomads, Elvhen can be found throughout the Tablelands.|
|  Human  | By far the most common race throughout the Tablelands, with an adaptable spirit that has led to frequent mutations and evolving psionic potential, which forces some to isolated retreats far from the psionic cacophony of the city-states.
|  Leonin  | Proud founders of the city-state Urik, with feline traits and a strict code of blood-won honor. Some abandon their pride to roam the wastes, searching for a  land free of the Sorcerer Kings' tyranny.|
|  Minotaur  | Peerless warriors and guides, the Minotaur are few in number but vast in legend. Split between the Kavar Legion and the Anshe Wanderers, they refuse to forsake their traditions despite Athas' best efforts at breaking their spirit.|
|  Seedling  | Short, xenophobic beings living in the last verdant spaces of Athas. Outside of these jungle homes, they are rarely seen in the city-states but can sometimes be found out in the desert villages of the Tablelands.|
|  Tarek  | The degenerated remnants of the Mountain Folk from ages past, these lumbering, dim-witted giants are mainly found in the various city-states as either guards, gladiators or laborers.|
|  Thri-Kreen  | Multi-limbed, insect-like hunters. Thri-kreen tribes are nomadic and rarely enter the city-states, preying frequently on the Elvhen as their paths cross in the desert. |
|  Ukoven | Cloistered half-elemental beings believed by many to be mere myths. While Ukoven exist for each of the four elements, Water Ukoven are the most rare and revered.|

# Aarakocra




<img src='https://i.ibb.co/QpcR32k/Aarakocra-1.jpg' style='position:absolute; top:90px; left:50px; height:410px; width:395px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



*“You are all slaves. You all suffer from the tyranny of the ground. Only in the company of clouds will you find the true meaning of freedom.”* 

― Kekko Cloud‐Brother, Aarakocra cleric

<br>

Aarakocra are the most commonly encountered bird-folk of the Tablelands. Some are from Winter Nest in the White Mountains near Kurn, while others are from smaller tribes scattered in the Ringing Mountains and elsewhere. 

These freedom‐loving creatures rarely leave their homes high in the mountains, but sometimes, either as young wanderers or cautious adventurers, they venture into the inhabited regions of the Tablelands.


<br>

### Wings Free in the Open Air

Nowhere are the Aarakocra more comfortable than in the sky. They can spend hours in the air, and some go as long as days, locking their wings in place and letting the desert thermals hold them aloft. In battle, they prove dynamic and acrobatic fliers, moving with remarkable speed and grace, diving to lash opponents with weapons or talons before turning and flying away.



### Aarakocran Society

Aarakocra tend to stay among the mountain peaks. They believe themselves superior to all other creatures because of their ability to fly above the world. 


Those who near their territory must be careful, for the Aarakocra see it as their obligation to protect the region. Winter Nest maintains trade relations with the city-states of Draj and Kurn, with the latter even building perches for Aarakocra to rest and do business- but they are on hostile terms with the bandit states of the Barrier Wastes and the city of Eldaarich. In fact, Eldaarich regularly sends out slavers to capture any Aarakocra they can find.

Other city-states tolerate Aarakocran characters but do not welcome them. Most landbound creatures are suspicious of strange creatures that fly over their herds or lands unannounced, and Templars, even in Kurn, have standing orders to attack creatures that fly over the city walls without permission. Still, merchants will do business with Aarakocra as long as they remain on foot, and even this distrust has not dissuaded some young bird-folk from exploring the world beyond their mountain sanctuary.

<br>

### Avian Mannerisms

The resemblance of Aarakocra to birds isn’t limited to physical features. Aarakocra display many of the same mannerisms as ordinary birds. They are fastidious about their plumage, frequently wafting great plumes of dust into their feathers in order to clean and scratch away any debris they might have picked up. 

From below, Aarakocra look much like large birds. Only when they descend to roost on a branch or walk across the ground does their humanoid appearance reveal itself. They have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies. Their plumage typically denotes membership in a tribe. Males are brightly colored, with feathers of red, orange, or yellow. Females have more subdued colors, usually brown or gray.

Many Aarakocra punctuate their speech with chirps and squawks, sounds they use to convey emphasis and to shade meaning, much as a human might through facial expressions and gestures. An Aarakocra might become frustrated with people who fail to pick up on the nuances; an Aarakocra’s threat might be taken as a jest and vice versa.

<br>

### Aarakocra Names
As with much of their speech, Aarakocra names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. When interacting with other races, Aarakocra may use nicknames gained from people they meet or shortened forms of their full names.

An Aarakocra of any gender may have one of these short names: Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, or Zeed.

### Aarakocra Traits
As an Aarakocra, you have the following racial traits.

**Ability Score Increase.**
Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.


**Age.**
Aarakocra reach maturity by age 3, and don’t usually live longer than 30 years.

**Alignment.**
Aarakocra tend towards neutrality with regard to law or chaos. With respect to good and evil, Aarakocran tribes usually follow the alignment of their leader. A tribe whose leader is neutral good will contain lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good and neutral members, with most members being neutral good. Aarakocra, even good ones, rarely help out strangers.

**Size.**
Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall. They have thin, lightweight bodies that weigh between 80 and 100 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.**
Your walking speed is 30 feet.

**Child of the High Mountains.** Aarakocra have advantage on saving throws against spells or powers that manipulate air such as *gust*.

**Talons.**
You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing 
damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

**Flight.** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed, but may not hover. In order to fly, an Aarakocra must have a minimum of 10 feet of open space on either side of them and 30 feet of open space above, below them or any combination (taking off from a ledge 15 feet above the ground and 15 feet below the ceiling is appropriate). 

You cannot fly while wearing heavy armor, carrying a heavy load, or while restrained, whether by a spell, net, lasso, grapple or any other effect.

At 5th level, your fly speed increases to 50 feet.

**Dive Attack.** An Aarakocra who flies at least 30 feet during a round, and has descended at least 20 feet at the end of that movement, deals one additional die of damage with the first melee attack made during that round.

**Languages.**
You can speak Common and Aarakocra. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background.

{{note
##### Roleplaying an Aarokocra
Adventuring Aarakocra are usually young adults with a taste for the unknown. They are usually curious, strong‐minded individuals that wish to experience the lives of the land‐bound peoples. Good tribes see these young ones as undisciplined individuals, but can tolerate this behavior. Evil tribes may view this sort of adventurous behavior as treacherous, and may even hunt down the rogue member. 

<br>

Confinement terrifies the Aarakocra. To be grounded, trapped underground, or imprisoned by the cold, unyielding earth is a torment few Aarakocra can withstand. While traveling, Aarakocra prefer to fly high above to get a good view all around of their location and detect any threats well in advance. When they stop to rest, they tend to perch on high peaks or tall buildings. Even then, they appear alert, with eyes moving and bodies ready to take flight.

# Changeling

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/ys8Pc43/Changeling-1.jpg' style='position:relative; top:-5px; left:-4px; height:383px; width:328px;' >

*"People are no good. You can only trust animals and the bottle.”* – Delmao, Changeling thief. 

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

Born from the unions of Elvhen and Humans, but rarely welcomed by either, Changelings tend to appear as their mother's race until adolesence. Only then do they discover they can shift their face and form with a thought, and the myriad ways this is more curse than blessing. Masks are a wearisome thing to constantly wear, and it's no surprise many Changelings only find true solace in the solitary wastes. In creating a Changeling adventurer, consider the character’s relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true Changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other Changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?

### Masks and Personas

In their natural form Changelings are slender and pale, with colorless eyes, silver-white hair, and short, but pointed ears. In physique, most tend more towards their human parentage, with a bulkier frame than most Elvhen and a good foot less in height. Some embrace their nature and defy the world's assumptions, but many choose to wear the mask of another race to pass without constant attention. A Changeling might, with careful study of a race's mannerisms, impersonate any humanoid roughly similar in size, though drastic transformations, such as to a Seedling or Tarek, lay beyond their capabilities. 

Some enjoy the vindication of proving themselves capable of blending into the Human or Elvhen communities that would cast them out, while others simply turn to different cultures, such as Thri-kreen or Duls, for companionship. They rarely maintain a friendship for long as it is their experience that discovery of their true nature causes suspicion to haunt their every step, but there are times when a Changeling might build trust with a particularly beloved person over and over again, wearing new faces each time and fleeing when they get too close for safety.

### Destined to be abandoned

Changelings don't form communities despite their numbers, perhaps because so very few had one to begin with. Humans speak of Changelings as insidious cryptids, and Elvhen have little patience for a half-kin child who can't keep up. For many Changelings, childhood is at best years of being kept at arm's length before being tossed out as their abilities manifest. Most will be forced to discover deception and imitation as tools of survival, only feeling truly seen by the beasts that can smell them out no matter their face. 

In adventuring parties, they tend to be aloof because it's likely to be a short-lived experience. Some find acceptance in the ranks of Templars, where their shapeshifting talents can allow them to hunt dissidents with ease and service to the Sorcerer-Kings ensures safe refuge. 

### Changeling Names

A Changeling tends to adopt new names as easily as they develop new faces. The true name of a changeling tends to be simple and monosyllabic; however, there are often accents to a changeling’s name that are expressed through shapeshifting, something single-skins will likely miss. So, two changelings might have the name Jin, but one is *Jin-with-vivid-blue-eyes* and one is *Jin-with-kohl-black-lips*.


Changelings tend to have a fluid relationship with gender, seeing it as one characteristic to change among many others.

Changeling Names: Bin, Cas, Dox, Fie, Hars, Jin, Lam, Mas, Nix, Ot, Paik, Ruz, Sim, Toox, Vil, Yug.

### Changeling traits

Changelings are accustomed to walking between worlds, both by the guises they wear within society and the familiarity they share with beasts.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. 



 



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
 {{width:5px}} **Age.** Changelings mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespan—typically a century or less. While a changeling can shapeshift to conceal their age, the effects of aging still catch up to them.

**Alignment.** Lawful and neutral Changelings labor for acceptance from the world, while chaotic ones have given up, rejecting the laws of societies that have rejected them.

**Size.** In their natural forms, Changelings average between 5 to 6 feet in height. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Changeling Instincts.** You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling Skill and 1 skill of the following: Deception, Insight, or Persuasion.

**Beast Speech.** You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with Beasts. They can understand the meaning of your words, though there is no guarantee they will be friendly and you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Animal Handling checks you make to influence them.

**Change Appearance.** As an action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. You can’t duplicate the appearance of a creature you’ve never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die. 

You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature more than two feet larger or smaller than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you have two arms, you can't mimic a Thri-kreen's secondary limbs, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don’t change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.

Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Deception check you make to avoid detection.

**Unsettling Visage.** When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses.

Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Languages.** You can speak Common and two other languages of your choice. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background.
{{note
##### Roleplaying a Changeling
Changelings are defined by the hostility and distrust of outsiders; they hide their communities and their true identities from others, revealing just enough to keep strangers from seeking more. They live in the shadows of the other races, using their wits and their gifts to survive. Most Changelings spend their lives in motion, traveling from place to place and never staying long enough to draw unwanted attention. They are seen as cursed and dangerous, and this very reputation has prevented them from gathering in any great number.

<br>

Think carefully about the masks your Changeling would choose to wear, and the purposes they serve. Personas could be tied to skills- perhaps a burly, craggy-faced brute for Intimidation, paired with an unassuming potter's apprentice for Stealth. 

<br>

Your character may even have inherited personas from other Changelings they've met- taking on the life of a town's courier while the person you've replaced fills your shoes for a time, for example.

# Dray

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/qNNtGky/Dray.jpg' style='position:absolute; top:100px; left:52px; width:350px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

<div style='margin-top:450px;'></div>

Dray are tall, lean draconic beings with scaly skin, hairless bodies, and clawed limbs. They have no wings, though they do have tails. Created by the Sorcerer-King Dregoth from the once human citizens of the isolated underground city of Giustenal, the Dray have little to no concept of what is happening on the surface world aside from ancient legends told by their immortal rulers.


### The First Generation


The first generation Dray were banished from Guistenal long ago. They currently inhabit the ruins of Kragmorta, struggling to survive and make a home in the fiery cavern. They are ruled by a Clan Father named Mosak, who does his best to keep the clan together. The first generation Dray still worship Dregoth as their god, but they also hate the undead dragon king for rejecting them. While most of their training and education comes from clan elders, the High Priest Absalom sometimes visits Kragmorta to teach them of Dregoth. For all their suffering, many pray to be taken back into the fold. 


### The Second Generation

The second generation Dray live in New Giustenal, where most live contented lives. The Templars protect them and see to their spiritual needs, so they are free to work and raise families. 

All second generation Dray are expected to battle in Dregoth’s army on the Day of Light that is to come, but until then only the Templars work to perfect their military skills. Everyone else lives in varying degrees of comfort, looking down upon the first generation they replaced. 

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>


### Distrust of the Other

All Dray distrust surface dwellers, though the second generation have been taught to also hate them. Most races, Dregoth has proclaimed, are to be scorned and killed, while humans are to be pitied until they can be transformed into Dray themselves. 

The Dray of Kragmorta have members of most classes but they have no Arcanists and do not even understand the concept of such magic. The Dray of New Giustenal can be of all classes, including Arcanists though there are no dedicated preservers. The most powerful group of Templars are the kalin riders. 

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

### The Kalin Riders

Dregoth’s most elite troops are the kalin riders. These mid-level Templars ride the ferocious kalin, predatory insects discovered in the under-region of the Dread King. For now, the kalin riders patrol the ceilings of New Giustenal looking for trouble in the streets below. Most citizens hate these troops because of the viciousness of the kalin, known to rip limbs from passing Dray with no cause, their riders unable to truly leash the insects' bloodlust.

<div style='margin-top:5px;'></div>

### Dray Names
First generation Dray often use human names, but second generation Dray are more likely to use draconic names.

**Male Names:** Arjhan, Balasar, Bharash, Donaar, Ghesh, Hesken, Kriv, Medrash, Mehen, Nadarr, Pandjed, Patrin, Rhogar, Shamash, Shedinn, Tarhun, Torinn

**Feminine Names:** Akra, Biri, Daar, Farideh, Harann, Havilar, Jheri, Kava, Korinn, Mishann, Nala, Perra, Raiann, Sora, Surina, Thava, Uadjit

### Dray traits

Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other Dray:

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 1.

**Age.**
Dray have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.


**Alignment.** Those of the first generation tend towards chaos as they live hard, struggling lives in the wastes. Those of the second tend towards law due to the comforts of Dregoth's domain.







{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
{{wide,column-count:2
 {{width:7px}} **Size.**
Dray are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.**
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Claws.** You grow retractable claws from the tips of your fingers. Extending or retracting the claws requires no action. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the normal bludgeoning damage for an unarmed strike.


\column

 {{width:7px}} **Darkvision.** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Fire Resistance.** You have resistance to fire damage.

**Languages.** You can speak Common and Guistenal. With DM permission, your character may be able to read and write with an appropriate background.

**Subraces.** Choose which generation you descend from, with each having developed unique traits:
}}
### The First Generation

These are the descendants of the first humans transformed into Dray, with hunched over bodies, jagged claws, and mottled, uneven scales. They barely survive in the ruins near Giustenal.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

**Breath Weapon**
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of burning energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 fire damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. 

This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Fire Warding.**
Starting at 5th level, as an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to fire damage. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

\column

### The Second Generation

Those descended from the second generation are lean, tall and powerfully built, told since the day they were born that they are the supreme mortal race on Athas. To them Humans are unfortunate souls who need to be brought in and transformed, whether they want to or not, and any non-humans are to be killed on sight.


**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

**Breath Weapon.**
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of burning energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 fire damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. 

This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).


You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Psionic Mind.** You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. Your communication doesn’t give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.

# Dul

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/ZY4gLy9/Dul.webp' style='position:absolute; top:90px; left:60px; height:440px; width:340px;' >

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

*“See, the trick is to break their will. Not too much, mind you. Nobody wants to watch a docile gladiator, and Duls are too expensive to waste as fodder. But, you don’t want them trying to escape every other day. Would you like to tell the arena crowd that their favorite champion will not be appearing in today’s match because he died trying to escape your pens?"*
―Gaal, Urikite arena trainer 

<br>

Born from the unlikely parentage of dwarves and humans, a Dul (pronounced “dual”, though "dull" is used as a derogatory prounciation) combines the height and adaptable nature of humans with the musculature and resilience of dwarves. Duls enjoy traits that are uniquely their own, such as their robust metabolism and almost inexhaustible fortitude. There are also unique difficulties the Dul also contend with- namely sterility, and the systemic institution of slavery which haunts them at every turn. 

Humans and dwarves do not frequently pair- the vast population of enslaved Duls in Athas is yet another sin of the Sorcerer-Kings. Dwarves and Humans sentenced to death find their executions come in the flesh-forges of Urik, where newborn Dul rise from boiling crucibles of flesh and souls. 

\column

### Strength and Endurance

Second only to the Tarek, the Dul is the strongest of the non-bestial humanoid races of the tablelands. Duls grow as high as seven feet, weighing upwards of 250 pounds, but carry almost no fat at all on their broad muscular frames. Universal Dul characteristics include angular, almost protrusive eye ridges, and ears that point sharply backwards against the sides of their heads. Most Duls are born with a jaundiced yellow tinge and hairless bodies. They are always sterile.

### Born to Chains

Duls are bred to fight or labor, learning by harsh lessons who they can trust to see their heart, and who looks at them only as tools. Duls tend to outlast others chained beside them, becoming protectors to the weak and and mentors to the young as they pass on the experience they've paid for in blood and despair. 

While those privileged enough to have never known a slave's life look down upon the Dul, those who've fought and worked beside them know the Dul are survivors, and loyal beyond measure to those they deem worthy. Slavers are wary around Dul, knowing the worth of their labor but careful to sell them off before such loyalties become dangerous. 

### The Prize and the Prod

All gladiators who perform well in the arenas receive some degree of pampered treatment, but Duls receive particular privileges. Ringmasters and labor wardens go a long way to blind Duls to life outside their circumstance, parading them between creature comforts and enticements while ever fearing the day their property learns it has a soul.  

Stoic and dull to pain, Duls are not easily intimidated by the lash. Masters are loath to shatter this illusion by maiming a Dul, although those who help a Dul escape will be tormented  to punish the Dul indirectly. Once a Dul escapes or earns their freedom, they continue to bear the burden of their early years. Duls are often heavily marked with tattoos that mark their ownership, history, and capabilities, making it easy for bounty hunters to track them down. Those without markings are always at risk of capture and resale into the abominable practice that looms over them.

### A Veiled Hope

There is one legend among Dul-- little more than a name, whispered from passing Druids and promised by abolitionist insurgents. The Veiled Alliance, rumored to safeguard freed slaves. To speak of them is a crime punishable by death, but the whispers remain, filling the restless dreams of those yet trapped in shackles.

### Dul names

Duls are given names with harsh tones meant to strike fear. Lacking families, a Dul might use a place for a surname, such as “Mersten of Nibenay.” 

**Male Names:** Aram, Athalak, Borthomar, Bost, Darok, Darus, Durn, Eben, Erekard, Gard, Harask, Marok, Morg, Rikard, Sanozar, Tomak, Uskan, Zedath, Zorus.

**Feminine Names:** Aisa, Aivel, Brithis, Callia, Demosis, Elina, Faivel, Himithis, Laivi, Mersten, Narisel, Raina, Reshel, Saditha, Tirshel, Uisel, Zerima.

### Dul traits

As a Dul, your body was forged for a purpose. Your mind, however, is your own, stubborn as a Dwarf and versatile as a Human. 

**Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a Dwarf and a Human for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be either.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2 and your Constitution score increases by 1.

**Age.** A Dul born from the flesh-forges enters the world full-grown, tending to develop their full cognition within days. Given their lot in life, few succumb to old age, but natural-born Dul have been known to reach the age of 85.

**Alignment.** Duls tend towards neutrality with respect to good and evil, but run the gamut with respect to law or chaos.  A few ambitious lawful Duls use the respect won from their fellow slaves to organize rebellions and strike out for freedom. Chaotic Duls, on the other hand, push their luck and their value as slaves to the breaking point, defying authority and holding little fear for the lash. 

**Size.** A typical Dul is 7 feet tall and weighs over 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Flesh-Forged.** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

**Relentless Endurance.** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use that trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Inexhaustible.** Your unique physique allows you work for longer periods of time compared to other humanoids. You have advantage on Forced March saves and all other saves to resist non-magical exhaustion.

**Languages.** You can speak Common plus a language of your choice. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background.


{{note
##### Roleplaying a Dul
Born to the flesh forges, you never knew familial love or affection; the taskmaster’s whip took the place of loving parents. As far as you have seen, all of life’s problems that can be solved are solved by force. You know to bow to force when you see it, especially the subtle forces of wealth, power, and privilege. The noble and Templar may not look strong, but they can kill with a word. 

<br>

In the slave pits, you knew some Duls that never sought friends or companionship, but lived in bitter, isolated servitude. You knew other Duls who found friendship in an arena partner or co–worker. You are capable of affection, trust and friendship, but camaraderie is easier for you to understand and express. Warriors slap each other on the shoulder after a victory, or give their lives for each other in battle. You don’t think of that sort of event as “friendship” – it just happens. <br>

<br>

Duls dislike what they fear, and they fear Arcanists. They resent that they were born without choice by a power the Arcanists employ for fickle ends, with no sacrifice on the Arcanist’s part, while the Dul’s power is born of pain and labor. You may never have been exposed to psionic study or clerical ways, but there is nothing preventing you from learning.

# Dwarf

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/Sfx8z0h/Dwarf-1.jpg' style='position:relative; top:-0px; left:-10px; height:455px; width:340px;' >

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>


*“The worst thing you can say to a dwarf is ‘It can’t be done.’ If he’s already decided to do it, he may never speak to you again. If he hasn’t decided, he may commit himself to it simply out of spite. ‘Impossible’ is not a concept they understand. Anything can be done, with enough determination.”* 

-- Sha’len, Nibenese trader

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

On Athas, dwarves are not subterranean miners but rather a long-lived, slowly dying race known for their relentless focus on a task to the single exclusion of all others. A dwarf’s chief love is toil, and they are at their happiest when tasked with causes that can be approached with a stoic single-mindedness for weeks, months, years, or even decades. Once their mind is committed to a task, it is near impossible to sway them away from it as they will refuse to listen to reason. Dwarves live for their focus, for those who die unable to complete a focus return from the dead to haunt their unfinished work. Dwarves rarely divulge their focus to anyone until it is finished.


### Short and Stout

Short and powerful, Dwarves stand between 4 1/2 and 5 feet tall. Their frames are often massive and hairless to cope with the heat and rigors of their work. Life in the Athasian wastes makes them rugged, tanned, and callused. 

\column
### The Focus

Focus is the central point of your existence, and no simple job will suffice. Work with your DM to come up with a starting focus and a new one if completed. None should be easy to complete and should take at least 1 week or longer to finish to be worthwhile. 

For example, Grelak, protector of his village, makes the retrieval of a sacred book stolen by raiders his focus. After a week of gathering clues, he sets out to liberate the artifact from its current owner in a trading post weeks away. On the way there, he gains the benefit of his dwarven focus for anything that would slow him because he is trying to reach the book. Later, he stops in Nibenay to rest and gets in a brawl. He doesn’t receive any bonuses because he isn’t actively pursuing his focus.

Some other examples of a focus might include:

- Buying a family member's freedom
- Crafting a masterwork weapon
- Building a free village in the wastes
- Constructing a shrine to the elements
- Ruining the life of someone who's wronged you
- Discovering what lies beyond the Silt Sea




### Dwarven Society

Dwarves are close-knit, formed around clans and focused on family. Ties of blood are honored above all but the focus. Family honor or dishonor is passed down to generations. A community is led by the *Urhnomous* (over-leader), and each clan by an *uhrnius* (leader). There are 3 main dwarven settlements in the Tablelands: Kled, near Tyr, and the twin villages of North and South Ledopolus on the southwestern edge. Dwarven oral tradition shares that they were once a mighty people living in vast cities, and many of these ancient ruins are still out there, buried and forgotten.

A dwarf’s relations outside their clans are often a function of their focus. Those who help them are respected, sensible companions. Those who hinder them are obstacles that must be removed. There is very little room for compromise in a dwarven mind.


### Dwarf Names

Names are granted by the clan leader, the *uhrnius*, after completing one's first focus. Dwarves do not have a surname and like many on Athas prefer using a town (Drog of Kled) if distinction is needed.

**Male Names:** Baranus, Biirgaz, Bontar, Brul, Caelum, Caro, Daled, Drog, Fyra, Ghedran, Gralth, Gram, Jurgan, Lyanius, Murd, Nati, Portek, Rkard, Sa’ram, Sult, Veso.

**Feminine Names:** Ardin, Erda, Ghava, Greshin, Gudak, Lazra, N’kadir, Palashi, Vashara.

### Dwarf traits

Dwarves are nonmagical by nature and abhor defiler magic- while a Dwarf Arcanist isn't impossible, it is very rare to see. Their Clerics lean towards steady earth and tend to avoid chaotic air, and they take to psionics with a vengeance. Dwarves leave villages at times to further a focus and to search for ancient dwarven ruins. They are highly prized as mercenaries because once contracted, their loyalty will never change.


**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and you choose to increase your Strength or Wisdom by 1. 


**Age.** Dwarves mature around age 35 and live up to 250 years, though the dangers of Athas often claim them well before this time.

**Alignment.** Dwarves tend lawful and good to neutral. Their devotion to an established hierarchy in villages means they tend to follow rules even to the point of ridicule.

**Size.** A typical dwarf stands about 4 1/2 to 5 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. You are not slowed by wearing heavy armor.

**Darkvision.** Despite living aboveground, your heritage allows you to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if in bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Tool Proficiency.** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tool of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.

**Dwarven Resilience**. You have Advantage on poison saves and resistance to poison damage.

**Dwarven Focus.** You set yourself to a task, and define it as your focus. Once per turn when making an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll which will directly further your focus, you may roll a Focus Die (which is a 1d6) and add it to the results. You have a number of Focus Die equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all Focus Die when you finish a long rest. 

Your focus cannot be just any task, it must be a difficult feat requiring at least a week to complete. You cannot choose a new focus until you have fulfilled your last one. Dwarves' commitment to this task is so strong, that if they die before completing it, there is a good chance that they will return as banshees in the wastes after 2d4 days, haunting their unfinished works. Discuss with your DM to ensure a focus is appropriate.


**Languages.** You can speak Common and Dwarvish. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background. Dwarves keep a long and proud oral history, and they have an old written language mostly used for writing history that they will never share to outsiders. Their native language is deep and throaty, full of guttural sounds and harsh exclamations that cause most non-dwarves to get raw throats if spoken for long.

\column
{{note
##### Roleplaying a Dwarf
Remember the intensity of your focus. Breaking it has grave social, philosophical, and spiritual repercussions. If you die before completion, your spirit may return as a banshee and you will have shamed your clan for generations to come. For someone to intentionally stand in the way of your focus is an assault on you. Your greatest satisfaction is completing the focus. Keep a serious attitude always. The only time you show your festive side (if you have one) is when you have recently fulfilled a focus or between setting a new one. At this time, your full joy and humor show, but you are vulnerable in some ways because you are lost in purpose.

# Elvhen

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/WFqpmJ6/Elvhen-1.png' style='position:relative; top:-7px; left:-10px; height:305px; width:335px;' >





*“Better to die with a spear in hand than live with shackles around your wrist.”* – Elvhen adage


<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

The Elvhen are a nomadic race of traders, herders, and raiders. Speed is the key to acceptance and respect amongst them, and those too injured to run are often left behind to die. Most rarely stay in one place for long, maintaining their absolute freedom through constant movement.

Elvhen culture, while ruthless, is also rich and diverse. They have turned celebration into an art form, taking any chance to partake in captivating elfsong and energetic dancing. Elvhen war parties are greatly feared in the deserts, for they are a deadly force of endurance and maneuverability.

Others might see Elvhen as hostile or lazy, which is true- but far from the full story. It is common to see an Elf idle for days until compelled to exert themselves, then abruptly sprint for miles without complaint. Athasian Elvhen rarely live past 140 years and prefer short, exciting lives over long, boring ones. They thrive in open spaces and tend to wither in captivity, making them poor choices on the slave block. 


### Long and Lean

Elvhen are long-limbed sprinters who stand between 6 1/2 and 7 1/2 feet tall with slender yet muscular builds, averaging 175 pounds. They have rugged skin in a wide variety of tones, with deeply etched, weatherworn features. They grow little to no facial hair, but the locks atop their head come in all colors, sometimes dyed to striking shades. They dress in loose garb fit for desert travel. 

### Trust is for fools

Elvhen have little racial unity, keeping to their own tribe and regarding outsiders as easy marks or potential dangers. If a companion shows promise, the Elf devises a series of “tests” that allows them to prove themselves worthy of trust. Should they pass, an Elvhen friendship is forever- but should that trust be betrayed, it can never be regained. 

In the tribe, Elvhen are all equals, except the Chief. The Chief is elected and rules for life, making all major decisions for the tribe, and Elvhen are expected to tithe them a choice piece of loot after every raid or trade. Holding out suggests a lack of loyalty. Their natural enemies are the Thri-kreen, who view elfmeat as a delicacy.

{{note
##### The Run
Those who cannot keep up die, and freedom in all matters is life. Most Elvhen don't lie, cheat, or steal out of malice. They see an opportunity and the gullible can't keep up. In their culture, an Elf is rewarded for being faster, both in wit and running. If you stop running, if you settle down, you wither.
}}


### Home is where the run takes you

Elvhen are nomads by nature, though they maintain semi-permanent settlements in the wilderness. Their ability to cover vast distances makes them master raiders, and they consider anywhere their legs can take them as their territory, to take from as they see fit. 

Elvhen may flippantly adventure for wanderlust, but those who persist often do so out of a desire for profit, glory, revenge, or loyalty. They like to boast about their accomplishments, weaving these into song. Elvhen often take keepsakes from memorable raids and sew them into their cloaks, flaunting the prizes back to their owners if possible. Custom dictates the victim congratulate the thief on his possession of such an attractive item (those who don’t are poor sports). 

### Rebels without a care

The Elvhen's raiding ways have little root in any grand cause against the Sorcerer-Kings' defilement. It is simply not in their nature to obey such dogma. Ambushing caravans and border settlements is a jolly pastime, and to the Elvhen, any dead left behind are proof of city-dwellers' folly. 

Time and again, ambitious Crusaders will mount campaigns to quell the Elvhen threat. The Elvhen find this good sport. Local tribes will shake on temporary alliances and enter competition to seize caravan routes and hunt Crusaders for trophies, watering the desert with blood for months. 

Eventually, the clash will subside as the Crusaders' strength wanes and the city-states' stores run low. Hungry merchants reluctantly welcome the Elvhen back into their markets, forced to barter against the very heirlooms taken off their comrades' corpses in order to meet the demands of trade. Peace resumes- but never for long.

### Elvhen Names

Naming of young runners is a sacred responsibility, given after the first interesting thing the child does while learning to run or changed because of an extraordinary deed performed during the rite of passage. Elvhen surnames indicate their family clan, with many clans bound to a single tribe.

**Male Names:** Botuu (Water Runner), Coraanu (First Elf, the Warrior Thief), Dukkoti (Wind Fighter), Haaku (Two Daggers), Lobuu (First Runner), Mutami (Laughs at Sun), Nuuko (Sky Hunter), Traako (Metal Stealer). 

**Feminine Names:** Alaa (Bird Chaser), Ekee (Wild Dancer), Guuta (Singing Sword), Hukaa (Fire Leaper), Ittee (Dancing Bow), Nuuta (Quiet Hunter), Utaa (Laughing Moon) 

**Tribe (Clan) Names:** Clearwater Tribe (Fireshaper, Graffyon, Graystar, Lightning, Onyx, Sandrunner, Seafoam, Silverleaf, Songweaver, Steeljaw, Wavedivers, Windriders clans); Night Runner Tribe (Dark Moons, Full Moons, Half Moons, Lone Moons, New Moons, Quarter Moons clans); Shadow Tribe; Silt Stalker Tribe (Fire Bow, Fire Dagger, Fire Sword clans); Silver Hand Tribe; Sky Singer Tribe (Dawnchaser, Dayjumper, Twilightcatcher clans); Swiftwing Tribe; Water Hunter Tribe (Raindancer, Poolrunner, Lakesinger clans); Wind Dancer Tribe (Airhunter, Breezechaser clans)


### Elvhen traits

Elvhen tend to any profession and trade that lets them act freely. This makes them poor students of the rigorous study of psionics, and rarely does anything but Air draw them to clerical study.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and you choose to increase your Intelligence or Charisma by 1. 

**Age.** Elvhen reach physical maturity around 20, undergoing rites to become adults, and live to 140.

**Alignment.** Elvhen tend chaotic because of their love of freedom and self-expression, and lean into neutrality for all but the good of their tribe.

**Size.** A typical Elf stands about 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 feet tall, with slender yet muscular sprinters' builds averaging 175 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.

**Burst of Speed.** Your heritage allows you to move in sprints. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.

**Elvhen Run.** You add your Constitution score to the number of miles you can travel in a day. You have advantage on forced march saves.

**Extreme Acclimation.** You are conditioned to the extreme weather of the wastelands and have advantage on all saves against extreme heat and cold.

**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

**One With the Land.** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by terrain, weather, or other natural phenomena.

**Languages.** You can speak Common and Elvish.  With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background. Each tribe has a distinct dialect. The language is filled with short, clipped words, run with a rapid staccato pace difficult for others to pick up. They disdain the slow, tedious languages of others but condescend to learn Common. Elvhen that learn other tongues often hide it to gain advantage. 

{{note
##### Roleplaying an Elvhen
Rely on guerilla combat skills – distance, maneuverability and speed. Never fight fair, and always be ready to run, whether it be from a battle, an awkward situation, or a jilted lover. When someone says they're your friend, dismiss them at first then give them a chance to prove it (without telling them). Ask them to give you a prized possession, or leave one of yours out to see if they take it. Pretend to sleep and listen to what they say about you. Remember- trust is for fools!

# Human

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/TwNbn5C/Human-1.jpg' style='position:relative; top:0px; left:0px; height:395px; width:320px;' >


<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

 *“Humans are fools and hopelessly naïve as well. They outnumber us; they are everywhere, and yet they have no more sense of their strength than a rat. Let us hope that the Datto stay that way.”* ―Dukkoti Nightrunner, Elvhen warrior

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

Humans are the dominant culture in the explored parts of Athas, known for their versatility and adaptability. Most tend to be ambitious and individualistic; even the tyranny of the Sorcerer Kings hasn’t stamped out this diversity. Other races often don’t know what to expect when meeting a human for the first time because predicting their behavior based on cultural norms is difficult. “It’s human nature” is a common saying when humans appear to take action for no apparent reason.

Humans tend to get along well with races they comingle with (most often Dwarves and Duls). Tareks and Thri-kreen are seen as dangerous monsters. Elvhen are considered flighty and untrustworthy. Seedlings are curiosities best handled from afar. Humans often serve as a go-between when one race deals with another.



### A broad spectrum

Men average 6 feet tall and 200 pounds while women range around 5 1/2 feet tall and 140 pounds. Most tend towards dark and bronze toned skin, though this is skewed somewhat by the tan most develop laboring under Athas' brutal sun. Humans are prone to mutations, and it is not uncommon to find exaggerated features, webbed feet, or even extra digits on hands and feet.


\column
### Mutations

Centuries of abusive magic have taken their toll on the human body. Some humans have marked alterations to their appearance, such as a bizarre symmetry, exaggerated facial feature, pointed ears, no facial hair, unusual skin coloration like copper or gray, etc. Humans are familiar with and unsurprised by such differences. Mutations do not affect gameplay and are purely for flavor. 

### Human names
 
Human names vary by region. For most a single name suffices. A noble will have a family surname but often revert to use of one name. Freemen often reference their occupations to avoid being taken for laborers or slaves, such as “Barek the Weaver.” 



{{note
##### Names by City-State
In Athas' ancient history, many far-flung cultures flocked to the Tablelands to survive. The regions below offer inspiration for choosing a name based on your character's city-state of origin; this does not necessarily reflect any physical attributes of your character, only the different dialects that have resulted from the city-states' origins.

- Balic (Greek)

- Draj (Mesoamerican) 

- Gulg (Niger-Congo)

- Nibenay (Chinese)

- Raam (Indian) 

- Tyr (Greek/Phoenician)

- Urik (Babylonian/Mesopotamia)

}}


### Human traits

As the most populous and adaptive race in Athas, humans defy any single description. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your ability scores all increase by 1.

**Age.** Humans tend to reach adulthood in their late teens and can live to around 80 years.

**Alignment.** Humans are too diverse to pin down, tending equally towards nobility as towards cruelty.

**Size.** Men average 6 feet tall and 200 pounds while women range around 5 1/2 feet tall and 140 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Natural Learners.**
You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice and one set of artisan's tools or one musical instrument of your choice.

**Human Determination.**
When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can do so with advantage. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Languages.** Common and one other language of your choice. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background.

# Variant Race: The Villichi

___
Psionics imbue nearly every aspect of life on Athas, causing some to be born as nearly living embodiments of the Way. The Villichi are psionic beings typically born of normal human parents. 


### Bad Omens

No one can predict when or where a Villichi child will be born. They are shunned by normal humans, although it is considered a bad omen to turn out a Villichi child. When they come of age they usually move to a convent of their kind, located somewhere in the Ringing Mountains. Villichi have the capacity to become very powerful psionicists, and consequently, are a powerful group. Encounters with Villichi are usually with an envoy, one sent to deal with a trading company or village.



### Close-knit and Guarded

Villichi have formed an extremely close knit community. They rarely attack one another and only rarely argue with each other. The location of the convent is a closely guarded secret; anyone who inadvertently finds it is usually mindwiped. This treatment may seem cruel, but it is a cruel world, and the Villichi are only concerned with surviving. Tareks and Changelings are looked upon with compassion, since they too are members of a group that meets with prejudice. 



### Villichi Traits

Most Villichi are indistinguishable from humans and are, more or less, a psionically adept subset of the human race.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

**Age.** Villichi mature a little faster then humans and can live on average to be 170 years old.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Mental Discipline.** You have resistance to psychic damage and you have advantage on all Wisdom saving throws.

**Mindlink.** You know the *mindlink* psionic talent. Once you reach 3rd level, you learn the *metaconcert* augment. Once you reach 5th level, you learn the *missive* augment. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your psionic ability for these powers.

**Naturally Psionic.** You gain a reserve of psionic energy represented by psi points. Your psi point maximum is 2, or your existing psi point maximum from another source (such as levels in a class with the Psionics feature) increases by 2. When you reach 5th level, your psi point maximum increases by an additional 2. All expended psi points are restored when you finish a long rest. Your psi limit is 2, and when you reach 5th level your psi limit increases to 4, if it is not already higher.


**Severed from Dreams.** Villichi sleep, but they don't dream as other creatures do. Instead, their minds draw memories and feelings from all those connected by The Way. As such, you are immune to spells and other magical effects that require you to dream, like *dream*, but not to spells and other magical effects that put you to sleep, like *sleep*.


**Languages.** You can speak Common. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background.

# Leonin

##


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*"The strongest of the pride are measured not by the beasts they fell in the desert, but by those they tame within themselves.”*

―Alric Stoneheart, Leonin Outcast

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>
Leonin are prideful and self-reliant, and those who swear loyalty to the Sorcerer-King Hamanu have no fear of the slavery and oppression that most in Athas struggle against all their lives. To a Leonin, you must take what you want or pay in blood, and those without strength to defend their honor deserve no mercy. For the city-state of Urik where Leonin are the apex of society, this attitude is law.

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

### Quick to Quarrel
Other races often perceive Leonin as quick to take offense, intolerant of criticism, or belligerent. The truth is that many Leonin simply enjoy fighting, whether verbal or physical. They take pleasure in argument, wrestling, sparring, and even battle, enjoying the opportunity to exercise their minds and bodies.

It follows, too, that Leonin aren't inclined to carry grudges. A warrior might react with sudden violence to an insult, but when the fight is over (and the Leonin's superiority proven), the insult is forgotten -- along with the vanquished foe.




\column
### Magnificent and Merciless

Leonin tend to be tall compared to humans and move with a boldness that suggests their physical might. Tawny fur covers Leonin bodies, and some grow thick manes ranging in shades from gold to black. While their hands prove as nimble as those of other humanoids, Leonin have retractable feline claws, which they can extend instantly. This, along with their ability to produce bone-shaking roars, gives most Leonin an air that readily shifts between regal and fearsome. 

Leonin often act with confidence, which can come off as imperiousness. While this can reassure their allies, it can also suggest defiance in the face of what they perceive as imposed authority or unworthy experts.


{{note
##### Urikite or Outcast?
Players interested in playing a Leonin must make an important decision -- 

<br>

• Do you live proud and powerful in Urik, where Leonin are treated equal to the Templars of Sorcerer-King Hamanu? 

<br>

• Or do you live in exile, free from the Sorcerer-Kings yet starving in the sand until you succumb to your bestial hunger and prey on the Bandit Wastes like so many before you?

<br>

Choose wisely, for few in Athas live as well as the chosen of Hamanu, and the Lion of the Desert will not spare those who reject his gifts. Are the legends of Star Rock truly worth sacrificing your honor? 

}}

### Leonin Society
Leonin have a matriarchal society, and each pride is led by an elder female called a “speaker”. Most female Leonin will stay within the pride they were born into, while the males will wander and marry into other prides. Despite their violent ways, 
the Leonin are no savages and appreciate woven textiles, bone sculpture, and intricate pottery.

### Leonin Names
Along with their personal names, Leonin identify themselves by their pride. A member of the Flintclaw pride with the personal name of Ziore, for example, would likely style herself as Ziore of the Flintclaw.

**Feminine Names:** Aletha, Atagone, Demne, Doxia, Ecate, Eriz, Gragonde, Iadma, Koila, Oramne, Seza, Ziore

**Male Names:** Apto, Athoz, Baragon, Bryguz, Eremoz, Gorioz, Grexes, Oriz, Pyxathor, Teoz, Xemnon, Xior

**Pride Names:** Embereye, Flintclaw, Goldenfield, Ironmane, Starfeller, Sunguides

### Leonin traits

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by l.


**Age.** Leonin mature and age at about the same rate as humans.


**Alignment.** Leonin tend toward lawful alignments, preferring strict codes of honor to both justify and restrain their frequent violence. Urikite Leonin lean towards neutral or evil alignments, depending on how far they take the liberties afforded to them in Urik, while Outcast Leonin represent neutral or good alignments that refuse to ignore the crimes of their kindred. 


**Size.** Leonin are typically over 6 feet tall, with some standing over 7 feet. Your size is Medium.


**Speed.**
Your base walking speed is 35 feet.


**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Claws.** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you can deal slashing damage equal to ld6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Additionally, you have advantage on grappling.

**Hunter's Instincts.** You have proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, or Survival. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against frightened condition.

**Daunting Roar.** As a bonus action, you can let out an especially menacing roar. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The DC of the save equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Leonin.

{{note
> ##### Roleplaying a Leonin

No matter your station, you know yourself to be worthy of all before you. Leonin respect those who respect themselves, and sneer at those who would shy away from strength and power. That is not to say they are incapable of cunning -- for Outcasts, it is a necessity of survival. It is moreso a condemnation of surrender, for the deserts of Athas suffer no weakness. 

<br>

Those you travel with are not immune to this. It is important to establish who among your allies is strongest, whether by word or deed. While you don't necessarily have to be the leader--though you may begin by assuming yourself best fit for the role-- it is vital that you test the others to be sure they are worthy to ally yourself with. 

<br>

Once you are sure of them, they will find no fiercer friend. A Leonin defends the honor and body of their war parties as they would their own pride, and suffers no challenge from outsiders. Support those in your pack, push them to be their best, and show no mercy to their enemies.

# Minotaur

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/WyYfn7P/Minotaur-1.png' style='position:relative; top:-5px; left:-3px; height:400px; width:320px;' >

*"Not wise to provoke a Minotaur. Listen to their stories and nod along if you value your limbs. ”*

―Jarek, Human innkeeper

<br>
Minotaurs are strong in body, dedication, and courage, true to their word and loyal until death. They might come across as boisterous braggarts or placid sentimentalists, but are likewise respected as peerless soldiers and trustworthy guides.  
<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

### Legends of the Clans

The history of the Minotaurs is a long and noble one, passed down in excruciating detail through campfire tales of ancient battles and long, intricate fables that take weeks to tell in their entirety. The most sacred legends of the Minotaur follow Kavar, a ferocious yet honorable warrior, and his lifemate Anshe, a wise and steadfast shaman. 

Their tragic story follows the unification of the Minotaur clans, and their fracturing after Kavar's armies were defeated by the Emperor Rajaat and Anshe was lost to the wastes, said to have taken her most loyal followers into a twisting labyrinth that would lead to a green land far from the wars which had stolen her love. 

Their legacies define the Minotaurs to this day, a few scant survivors split into two clans. The Kavar Legion, unmatched warriors whose keen tactical acumen belies a simmering rage said to be Kavar's final bellow roaring through the ages, and the Anshe Wanderers, blessed with a supernaturally strong sense of direction that guides their endless quest to find Anshe's final resting place. 

### Burdened by Memory
Minotaurs aren't generally quick to anger, but stories of their limb-rending fury when provoked mean few dare to test that. They are passionate, loving friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes. Yet beneath this lies a deep melancholy. 

With their rich and honored histories, the Minotaur know better than many just how much has been lost in Athas. For some this might be expressed by a rushing, desperate desire to chase life’s highs in the bloodrush of battle and hedonistic indulgence, while others are solemn, morose souls seeking purpose in the small moments of goodwill they can offer to this barren world.  


### Horns and Hooves

Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often ornament their horns with rings of bone or painted wood.

Manes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves. Minotaurs are born with long, tufted tails, but Minotaurs of the Ordruun line (and some others) have their tails docked as part of a coming-of-age ceremony; they find the heavy armor of the Kavar Legion much more comfortable without a long tail in the way.

### Family and Legacy
Minotaur legends describe a small pantheon of heroes who established the Minotaurs' place in the world. Every Minotaur in Athas claims descent from one of these heroes.

The Ordruun line is the most prominent, with many of the Kavar Legion eager to claim ancestry with the ancient hero who rallied countless clans to Kavar's banner. Other important family lines include the Kharran line, who taught the Minotaur how to build with adobe, the Drendaa line, who tend to the herd beasts of Minotaur encampments, and the Tazgral line, who have long sought to map the furthest places of Athas.

With the Minotaurs' numbers dwindling after centuries lost to war and the endless search for Anshe, family is more important than ever. Regional councils are called each season, where those wishing to settle and raise children can gather and set off together. When a Minotaur grows too old to fight or wander, they are dutybound to care for the young and teach future generations. To be a Minotaur is to seek the impossible, and watch it slip from you each day- then wake and go after it again with all your might.

### Minotaur Names
The legends that recount the deeds of Kavar and Anshe are full of other names as well: those of the retainers, allies, lovers, servants, enemies, and others who played roles, however small, in the lives of the heroes. Almost every Minotaur name is drawn from that long list of minor characters of legend, so that those folk are never forgotten.

**Male Names:** Alovnek, Brogmir, Brozhdar, Dornik, Drakmir, Orazhan, Grozdan, Kalazmir, Klattic, Me-Jislek, Nirikov, Prezhlek, Radolak, Rugilar, Sarovnek, Svarakov, Trovik. Vraslak, Yarvem

**Feminine Names:** Akra. Bolsa, Cica, Oakka, Drakisla, Eleska, Enka, lrnaya, jaska, Kalka, Makla, Noraka, Pesha, Raisha. Sokali, Takyat, Vrokya, Veska, Yelka, Zarka, Zoka


### Minotaur traits

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

**Age.** Minotaurs enter adulthood at around the age of 17 and can live up to 300 years.


**Alignment.** Minotaurs tend towards lawful and good alignments, bound to traditions urging empathy and service. 


**Size.**
Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and have stocky builds weighing around 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.**
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Labyrinthine Recall.** You always know which direction is north, and you have advantage on any Survival check you make to navigate or track.

**Horns.** Your horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

**Goring Rush.** Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.

**Hammering Horns.** Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you.

**Imposing Presence.** You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Intimidation or Persuasion.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.

{{note
##### Roleplaying a Minotaur
In the city-states of Athas, Minotaurs are often found as wandering Kavar Legionnaires or Anshe Wanderer desert guides, but that's not the only lives they lead. Many have found glory as gladiators in the arena, or work as muscle with the Veiled Alliance to seek justice against the Sorcerer-Kings for their role in Kavar's defeat. 

<br>

Minotaur culture is tied inextricably to their clan and their family line, and it's likely you grew up under heavy expectations. Dig into your character's lineage to find what they might value, or perhaps the legacy they've always felt suffocated by. 

<br>

Minotaur also tend to be well-traveled compared to other races, whether by moving from battle to battle with the Kavar Legion or training in the desert lore of the Anshe Wanderers. How have you been impacted by the different places you've been, and the different people you've met there?

# Seedling

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/smsFJXX/Seedling-1.jpg' style='position:relative; top:-5px; left:-12px; height:420px; width:340px;' >

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

*“Be wary of the forest ridge. The seedlings who live there would as soon feed you to the trees as look at you. Chances are you won’t even notice them until you’re stuck by a spear.”*
―Mo’rune, Elvhen Nomad
 
<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

Seedlings are the masters of the Ringing Mountains' jungles. They are small, quick, and agile creatures steeped in an ancient and rich culture that goes back far into Athas’ past. Although they are not common in the Tablelands, some leave their homes in the forests to adventure under the dark sun. While omnivores, Seedlings prefer a meat-based diet and let no flesh go to waste, often growing the trees of their jungle by planting seeds within the carcasses of trespassers. 

Seedlings have difficulty understanding others’ customs or points of view, but curiosity helps some overcome their xenophobia. Little concerned with material wealth, Seedlings are more concerned with how their actions will affect other Seedlings. 

### Small and savage

Seedlings are small creatures, standing only about 3 1/2 feet tall and weighing 50 to 60 pounds. Rarely affected by age, Seedling faces are often mistaken for the faces of human children, even the elderly among them. They dress in loincloths, sometimes with a shirt or vest, and paint their skins with bright reds and greens. Forest Seedlings often let their hair grow to great lengths in intricate, beaded braids. 

\column

### Ancient culture

Seedling culture dominates their relations with others and predates Human civilization. Rarely will they ever draw the blood of another Seedling.

Seedlings of different tribes share a tradition of song, art and poetry, which serves as a basis of communication. Creatures that do not know these cultural expressions are often at a loss to understand a Seedling’s expressions, analogies and allusions to well–known tales. Seedlings can easily become frustrated with such “uncultured” creatures and lose patience with outsider intolerance of their ways, such as eating other humanoids. They abhor slavery and most Seedlings will starve themselves or die killing their jailers than rather than accept being chained.

### Fear of outsiders

Seedlings have no desire to see their home become like the rest of Athas. They are fierce and merciless in its defense, uncaring about the struggles and excuses of other races. Seedlings’ bond with nature extends into most aspects of their culture. A Chieftain, who also acts as a spiritual leader, often rules their clans. This leader is obeyed without question. Seedling fighters willingly sacrifice themselves to obey their leader, leaving outsiders to perceive them as blood-letting fanatics though Seedlings dearly love and enjoy life.

Exploring the Tablelands gives curious Seedlings the opportunity to learn other customs. Although they may at first have difficulty in understanding the numerous practices of the races of the Tablelands, their natural curiosity enables them to learn and interact with others. Other Seedlings may be criminals, renegades, or other tribal outcasts, venturing into the Tablelands to escape persecution by their kin. Most tribes reject arcane magic entirely, and even the few with preserver Chieftains would sacrifice an entire tribe to keep one defiler out.

### Seedling names

Seedlings have only one name assigned at birth.

**Male Names:** Basha, Cerk, Derlan, Drassu, Entrok, Kakzim, Lokee, Nok, Pauk, Plool, Sala, Tanuka, Ukos, Zol. 

**Feminine Names:** Alansa, Anezka, Dokala, Grelzen, Horga, Jikx, Joura, Nasaha, Vensa.

### Seedling traits

Seedling traits reflect their feral nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 1.

**Age.** A Seedling reaches adulthood at the age of 30 and generally lives into the middle of their second century.

**Alignment.** Seedlings tend towards law and can be described as neutral or evil, depending on the situation. Uncomfortable with change, Seedlings tend to rely on intangible constants, such as racial identity, family, clan ties, and personal honor. Seedlings generally have little respect for the laws of the big people.

**Size.** Seedlings average around 3 1/2 feet tall and 50 to 60 pounds. Your size is Small.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**Lucky.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die once and must use the new roll. You can use this ability three times before all uses are expended, and regain all uses after a long rest.

**Brave.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Seedling Nimbleness.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of larger size than yours.

**Hunter’s Lore.** You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.

**Cunning Artisan.** As part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, humanoid, monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a javelin, or 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate artisan’s tools, such as leatherworker’s tools.

**Fury of the Small.** When you damage a creature with an attack or spell and the creature’s size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.

**Languages.** You can speak Seedling and Common. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background. Your culture uses drawings and tales rather than a written language. Seedlings rarely teach others their language, but some individuals of the Tablelands have learned the wild speech. Seedlings found in the Tablelands learn Common to survive, but it is generally unknown past the Ringing Mountains.

\column

{{note
##### Roleplaying a Seedling
Remember to consistently take your height into account. Role-play the Seedling culture described above: feeding foes to the land, wasting no resouce, treating fellow Seedlings with trust and kindness, showing suspicion for big people, and having a general lack of interest in money. Conquest and plundering have no place in your society; rather the most important value is the ability of the inner self to harmonize with its environment. 

<br>

You should be sickened by the landscape of the Tablelands and desperately want to avoid any risk of that devastation ever spreading to your homelands in the Forest Ridge. You will learn about other cultures, but you should firmly believe Seedling culture to be innately superior to all others. However, you don’t try to change others' cultures, no more than you would try to convince a tembo to change its diet.

<br>

While omnivorous, you vastly prefer meat, and everything is a source of food. You should presume most other races will eat anything, including Seedlings, if they are hungry enough, and this makes it hard to trust them.

# Tarek

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/2ZDBJqB/Tarek-1.jpg' style='width:320px;' >
<br>

*“Mind of a child, strength of three grown men. I’ve seen a Tarek tear the walls out of a building because he wanted a better look at the tattoos on a Dul inside.”* – Daro, human trader 

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

Once, the Ringing Mountains bore more than Seedlings and death- Giants and Orcs strode together, cousins of a kind. When Athas' oceans turned to silt and the Sorcerer-Kings came to the Tablelands, however, the Mountain Folk were pushed high into the peaks where food was scarce. Their populations intertwined into the Tareks, and over the centuries dwindled. Eventually, most lowlanders forgot the Mountain Folk entirely. 

Until the Seedlings forced them from their last bastions, sending Tareks tumbling down to crash against the city-states' gates. The Sorcerer-Kings found them sun-addled, degenerated- and good at taking orders.  It didn't take long for the shackles to fall, the Sorcerer-Kings' tyrannical dogma forced upon them like ink to fresh parchment.

The dark sun has scorched away all memory of their old traditions, and so they readily imitate customs and cultures of those they admire or associate with. They are very imitative, eager to fit into a world that is not built for their size. One observing a Dwarf mine might decide to try their hand at it, then move on if they do not excel at it. Many find they excel at breaking bones and imitate those who are also skilled at this practice, making them widely sought out as gladiators, guards, and mercenaries across the Tablelands. 


### Big and strong

Tareks are enormous individuals, generally 8 to 9 feet high and weighing upwards of 500 pounds. Though they have features harkening back to the Giants and Orcs of their origin, these tend to be exaggerated in some ways. Skin tones range from light brown to deep tan, like sand. They vary in hair color and tend to wear whatever hair style or fashion they currently are emulating. A tavern would charge extra for filling enough plates for a Tarek-sized appetite, and any armor would have to be specially crafted. Most nobles, Templars, and merchant houses feel the investment is worth the return when they have 500 pounds of enforcement at their command.

### Impressionable

The most powerful warriors on Athas, Tarek seem content to dwell in humanity’s shadow and drift towards charismatic leaders of all races. For example, if a Tarek village is near Elvhen raiders, they are likely to emulate the guerilla tactics of the elves. A Tarek farmer's village might be raided, and he may soon adopt the morals of the invaders because they seem to know what they're doing, and the Tarek finds he's pretty good at smashing heads too. Many believe this innate whim derives from early Tareks' need to assimilate in order to survive in Athasian society. 


{{note
##### Alignment on a Whim
One axis of your alignment will be fixed and the other subject to change, even daily, based on influential events or persons around you that you find a reason to emulate or admire. You will try out their morals or philosophies and perhaps stick with it for a time if you're good at it. This does not mean Tareks are unreliable - the influence must be strong for them to change, and they have a core philosophy that is fairly unchanging. 

<br>

A Tarek soldier might see a Dwarven Cleric of the sun and be impressed by her unflappable devotions. He may try shaving himself and praying to the sun, until he finds he cannot stare at the sun without hurting his eyes and cannot make fire appear.

<br>

This can make role-playing a Tarek a challenge.
}}

### Tarek Names

Enslaved Tareks often have Human names matching the city-state they're in, and because of this they vary greatly. Free Tareks are likely to borrow the naming conventions of the race or people they are imitating at the time their child is born. See other races for name suggestions.

### Tarek traits

The Tarek have lost much, but not their strength.

**Ability Score Increase.**  You have 4 points to split between your Strength and Constitution scores. Your Strength score can reach a maximum of 22 instead of 20. Your Intelligence and Wisdom scores are decreased by 2 each. 

**Age.** Tareks mature around 24 years of age and can live up to 220 years. 

**Alignment.** Your alignment may fluctuate as described in Alignment on a Whim. You begin with one fixed alignment axis (Good - Neutral - Evil or Lawful - Neutral - Chaotic) that will never change. The other axis may change depending on who you are emulating. Subject to DM approval, when imitating a charismatic leader, select an appropriate Ideal or Flaw and replace your current one. If the new Ideal is tied to a non-fixed axis of your alignment, change that aspect of your alignment. 

**Size.** A typical Tarek stands 8 to 9 feet tall and weighs between 460 and 550 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Colossal Endurance.** Your immense body mass allows you to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total. You  can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.



**Giant’s Metabolism.** You require more food and water then the average humanoid. You require 2 pounds of food and 2 gallons of water per day or 4 gallons if the weather is hot.

**Strength of Mountains.** You have advantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws. In addition, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

**Tight Fit.** You cannot wear ordinary gear sized for smaller creatures such as boots, gloves, and backpacks. All armor, clothing, armor, meals, and lodging cost double for you. You can have armor or weapons resized by a trained crafter, the cost of which which begins at 10 to 40% of the armor price, reflecting the extra materials needed. The DM can either roll 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Languages.** You can speak Common. Your voice is always low, making it difficult for most to hear and understand more than a rumble. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background.

{{note
##### Roleplaying a Tarek
Always remember you are the largest humanoid race in Athas, far bigger and heavier than everyone else. Take advantage of your height, but also remember the disadvantages. Between your size and your lesser wits (even if you are a relatively intelligent Tarek, people will assume you to be dull), you find yourself an object of comic relief, mistreated and ignored. You are used to being teased and will endure more witty remarks than most people, but when you have been pushed too far your personality can suddenly shift, and you can unleash astonishing violence on your tormentors and any who stand in your way. 

<br>

Less frequently, these shifts can happen to you without provocation -- you just wake up with a different ethos and altered disposition, or adopt a whole new outlook on life after hearing a particularly convincing speech or display. Remember you are influenced by powerful personalities, which can shift your own self and ethics. You tend to imitate the tactics, clothes, and demeanor of those you travel with, whether they be close friends or "little masters".

# Thri-kreen

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/ZNYX1dL/Thri-kreen-1.png' style='position:absolute; top:70px; left:30px; height:420px; width:380px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

*“This one does not speak with the quivering soft shells that lay about all night. This one might eat you, but never speak.”* ―Tu’tochuk 

:

Thri‐kreen ("kreen" for short) are the strangest of the intelligent races of the Tablelands. These insectoid beings born from eggs possess a mindset very different from any humanoid being encountered. They roam the wastes in packs, hunting for food day and night, since they require no sleep. Thri‐kreen are quick and agile and make fearsome fighters, feared throughout the wastes. They refer to Thri-kreen who have become city dwellers as “Tohr-kreen,” meaning “settled person,” whereas Thri-kreen means “wanderer-person.”

### Insect body

Mature Thri‐kreen stand about 7 feet tall, with a rough body length of 11 feet. Their four arms end in claws; their two legs are extremely powerful, capable of incredible leaps. However, kreen are unable to jump backwards. Their body is covered with a sandy–yellow chitin, a tough exoskeleton that grants the Thri‐kreen protection from blows. Their head is topped with two antennae, and their two eyes are compound and multifaceted. The kreen mouth consists of small pincers. Male and female Thri‐kreen are physically indistinguishable. Thri‐kreen usually do not wear clothing, but wear some sort of harness to carry weapons and food. 

Many wear leg or armbands, or bracelets. Some attach rings on different places on their chitin, though this requires careful work by a skilled artisan. While most Thri-kreen appear identical to non-kreen, their nuances of exoskeleton development render them quite unique in their view. Pheromone release modifies their eye coloration: light for pleasant feelings and dark for distress. They are carnivores and become sick if eating plants, the only exception being a handful of common spices and fruit-based potions.

### No sleep required

Since Thri‐kreen do not require sleep, they have difficulty understanding this state of “laziness” in others. Other behaviors of humanoids seem unnecessarily complex. A kreen’s life is simple: hunt prey. Kreen live for the hunt, and own only what they can carry. Their knowledge is largely passed by an instinctual racial memory shared with the clutch. At birth, they already know the best prey and ways to catch them.

### A different perspective

The pack mentality dominates a kreen’s relation with others. Kreen hunt in small groups and will move to other areas rather than depopulate an area of prey. Thri‐kreen view humanoids as possible sources of food but rarely hunt them as humanoids are not simple prey. Many kreen have a particularly fond taste for elves; as such, meetings between these two races are often tense. A kreen considering joining a war party will often try to establish dominance by making threatening gestures, which can disturb potential allies. To them, this is natural, and makes for a clear heirarchy. Once the matter is settled, they will consider the humanoids part of their clutch and never turn on them, no matter what comes. 

Kreen have a severe fear of any large body of water, as they cannot swim or float. They have no idea how to ride another creature and find the concept alien and nonsensical. 

### Racial memory

Contrary to the variety of humans, Thri-kreen are largely predisposed to certain roles due to their racial memory. They typically have no Arcanists; their lack of natural sleep and need to hunt makes it impractical, but kreen take to psionics as a way of life and the hunt. They revere the elements and ancestral memory causes them to revere the Great One, a legendary leader from many clutches past.


### Thri-kreen names

The kreen language is very different from those of the other intelligent races. They have no lips or tongues, and so cannot make the same sounds humanoids make. Kreen language is made up of 
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
clicks, pops, or grinding noises. They do not distinguish male and female names.

**Names:** Cha'ka, Chuka-tet, Drasna, Drik-chkit, Hakka, Ka'cha, Ka'tho, Klik-chaka'da, Lakta-cho, Qhak'cha, Qhik-ik-cha, Sa'Relka, T'Chai, Tak-tha.

### Thri-kreen traits

Thri-kreen physiology gives it several natural advantages that compensate for not being able to easily use items commonly worn by other races.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and either your Strength or Wisdom score increases by 1. 

**Age.** A Thri-kreen is born from an egg and becomes fully mature at 6 years. They demonstrate no effect of aging until they reach the end of their life cycle around 30 years. Sensing their death, such Thri-kreen go on a final hunt. 

**Alignment.** Most Thri‐kreen are chaotic, acting in whatever fashion benefits the pack mentality, and this rarely leads them to philosophies of good and evil.

**Size.** Thri-kreen height can range from 4 and a half to 7 feet tall and weight can range from 100 to 375 lbs. You size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.

**Creature Type.** You are a Monstrosity.

**Carapace.** While you aren’t wearing armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier. 

You can wear armor but it must be specially made or altered to fit your frame. Such armor costs twice the normal amount. These restrictions do not apply to shields.


**Thri-kreen Weapon Training.** You are proficient with the gythka, chatkcha, and your natural weapons.

**Thri-kreen Physiology.** You require half as much water as other races, needing only half a gallon of water per day, or one gallon per day if the weather is hot.

**Sleepless Revitalization.** You do not require sleep and are immune to sleep effects. You need only 4 hours of light activity to gain the benefits of a long rest. You are not required to make saves for a Forced March.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Secondary Arms.** You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms can stow or retrieve one item each turn, open or close a door or container, pick up or set down a Tiny object, or manipulate an object without using an action. They cannot be used to wield weapons or shields. 


**Leap.** Whenever you make a long or high jump, you can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as normal.

**Natural Weapons.** Your maw and claws can be used to make unarmed strikes. 

If you hit with one of your Claws, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. 

If you hit with your Bite, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

Starting at 5th level, you add Thri-keen venom to your Bite attack. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute; if failed by 5 or more, the target is paralyzed for the duration. The target repeats the save at the beginning of its turn to end the effect. If they succeed, they are immune to this effect for 24 hours.





**Languages.** You can speak Thri-kreen and Common. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background. Thri-kreen is a language composed of clicks and whirring, antennae movements, and pheromone emissions that non-kreen find too difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. When you speak other languages, you use a high-pitched voice.


<br>

{{note
##### Roleplaying a Thri-kreen
You tend to rely on your natural attacks and special kreen weapons. Everything you kill is a potential dinner. You have a strong need for a party leader – obedience to this leader in the party is important to you. If you seem to be the most powerful and capable, then you will assume leadership; if someone challenges your authority then you will wish to test whether they are in fact stronger than you. It is not a question of vanity; you won’t want to fight to the death, but merely to ascertain who is worthy to lead the party. 

<br>

You do not have the focus of a Dwarf to complete a project, but you would give your life to protect your companions. If you did not trust and honor them as your own family, then you would not travel with them and work together with them. You do not understand the concept of sleep. It disturbs you that your *dra* (sentient meat creatures like humans) companions lie unconscious for a third of their lifetimes. Spend your rest periods watching them in this state. 

<br>

You own only what you can carry, caring little for money or other items that other races consider as treasure. Your philosophy of ownership sometimes leads you into conflict with presumptuous *dra* who think they can own buildings, land, and even whole herds of carru!

# Ukoven


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/p6HJWwc/Ukoven.webp' style='position:absolute; top:90px; left:-25px; width:460px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;' />
<div style='margin-top:240px;'></div>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

The reclusive Ukoven, also known as half-elementals, are little more than legend, and tales from those who encounter them are often dismissed as outright lies. The Ukoven are unknown to most people inhabiting the Tablelands, and for good reason. They make their homes on the tiny islands rising from the vast Silt Sea spreading out to the east, far from the city-states and their trade routes. The Ukoven have nothing but disdain for civilization, sneering at the Sorcerer-Kings and their despotic rule. They have no love for the mortal races, and their arrogance is equaled only by their mercurial temperaments. They are a people apart, content to struggle in the swirling dust storms and having no part in the plight faced by the despotic regimes that define the Tablelands.

Or so people have believed until now. For the first time in memory, the Ukoven have begun an exodus from their hidden redoubts and are now exploring the lands they abandoned years ago. What they seek, and why they have chosen this time to venture into the realms of the Sorcerer-Kings, no one knows. But their emergence is unmistakable, and those who live along the shores of the Silt Sea wonder if this trickle presages a greater and more terrible flood.

### Children of the Elements

The Ukoven are often called half-elementals because of their humanlike forms. They are the same size and shape as Humans, though they are slightly bulkier, and thus they are mistaken for having human ancestry. Their elemental nature, however, is unmistakable, and the power of the Elemental Plane bleeds from them through their tempestuous personalities and the manifestations in their flesh.

The Ukoven in Athas today are descended from ancestors considered “purer” in their manifestations. Stories abound in Ukoven communities of those predecessors manifesting the elements of air, fire, earth, and water. Mingled bloodlines combined with the ever-changing world have resulted in new elemental manifestations.

Elemental manifestations are what give Ukoven their distinctive appearance. Instead of hair, all Ukoven possess a corona corresponding to their elemental heritage. Examples include wreaths of smoke, flames, or crystalline growths.

Ukoven also display glowing patterns in their skin, appearing similar to lines and whorls. Soft light in a color associated with a Ukoven's elemental manifestation shines from their patterns. Ukoven from the same tribe have the same color and shape of pattern, which is a useful identifier of origin. Facial patterns are unique to each individual.

### Ukoven Names
Ukoven assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Basin, Eddy, Breeze, or Malachite. Some will adopt new names in the tongues of those they travel among. 




### Ukoven Traits
Your Ukoven character has certain characteristics in common with all other Ukoven.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Languages.** You can speak Common and Primordial. With DM permission, your character might be able to read and write with an appropriate background. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.

**Subraces.** Four major subraces of Ukoven are found among the Athas: air Ukoven, earth Ukoven, fire Ukoven, and water Ukoven. Choose one of these subraces.


{{pageNumber,auto}}

### Air Ukoven
Air Ukoven typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air Ukoven speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.

<div style='margin-top:25px;'></div>

### Earth Ukoven
Some earth Ukoven always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth Ukoven can also have smooth metallic looking flesh, dull iron colored skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1.

**Earth Walk.** You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without expending extra movement.

You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate levels. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

\column


### Fire Ukoven
Nearly all fire Ukoven are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more Human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads.

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.


<div style='margin-top:40px;'></div>

### Water Ukoven
Most water Ukoven look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water Ukoven's hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.

### Forbidden Classes
The **Artificer**, **Bard**, and **Sorcerer** do not exist as player classes in Dark Sun. 

#### Artificer

Athas is a barren, magic-starved world where the inventions and enchantments of artificers would fundamentally clash with the characterization of magic in this setting.

#### Bard

While bards exist, they are known better as entertainers leading double lives as spies and assassins who would not want the attention that magic brings in Athas.



#### Sorcerer 
Having innate arcane magic within yourself as the source does not work in the setting of Athas. Any mention of Sorcerers in Dark Sun is simply another name for powerful Arcanists (such as the Sorcerer-Kings). 

<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Changes to Classes and their Archetypes
Many of the classes represented on the following pages have a curated selection of archetypes, and may feature revisions to their class and archetype features. All changes were made in the name of both balance and consistency with the lore of Athas.

# Arcanist

Arcane magic is outlawed in every city-state. Yet Arcanists still study the arcane arts, whether rediscovering forbidden lore in study of ancient texts or apprenticing within ambitious cabals, drawn to the temptations of magic even at the risk of their lives. Arcanists are universally distrusted, for it is they who Athas can blame for its barren, savage state. 

Save those rare few independent spellcasters bound to the Sorcerer-Kings, Arcanists in Athas are likely revolutionaries or exiles. They must take extreme steps to hide their nature, even from those few they may trust. Many pretend at being Clerics or psionicists, for fear of the reprisals that would visit not only them, but all known to have helped or associated with their ilk. 
<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Arcane Masteries


The study of magic is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries. Once, Arcanists were trained in vast academies with repositories of knowledge beyond the comprehension of any living Athasian. Today, Arcanists are defined by action more than philsophy, and the old schools have fallen in favor of titles which even the lowest slave can understand as both curse and warning. 


* **Caller.** Summon your whims to hand with spells focused on conjuring objects and creatures.

<br>

* **Magus.** Specialize in battle magic by empowering your spells and bolstering your defenses. 

<br>

* **Mesmer.** Hone your abilities to magically entrance and beguile
other people and monsters.

<br>

* **Mirage.** Dazzle their senses, befuddle their minds, lead them astray- you are the mirage, the illusion.

<br>

* **Necromancer.** Sap the strength of those who stand against you, and raise the dead as allies.

<br>

* **Prophet.** Master spells of
discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge,
and foresight.

<br>

* **Ravager.** Use the spectacular power of the arcane to rend, incinerate, and obliterate your enemies.

<br>

* **Warder.** Deny the blow, the curse, the enemy advance- yours is the art of defense and shielding.

\column

## Creating an Arcanist

Creating an Arcanist demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?

What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other Arcanist? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.

{{pageNumber,auto}}

## Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing the first glimmerings of your true power. See Chapter 9 for the rules of spellcasting and Chapter 10 for the Arcanist spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Arcanist spell list. You learn additional Arcanist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Arcanist table.


#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Arcanist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Arcanist spells that are available for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of Arcanist spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Arcanist level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're a 3rd-level Arcanist, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *magic missile*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Arcanist spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast Arcanist spells as rituals if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. The spell does not have to be prepared. 

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Arcanist spells.

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain an Arcanist level, you can add two Arcanist spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Arcanist table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).

#### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level Arcanist spells of your choice.

<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Your Spellbook
The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the magic you develop as your power grows, whether from instinctual insights or spells found recorded on scrolls stolen from Templar vaults or rediscovered in dusty tomes from ancient tombs. 

***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find an Arcanist spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the Arcanist who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the verbal and somatic components, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. 

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 ct. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks needed to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell like other spells.

***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book— for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This follows the same rules as copying another's work, with the material costs reduced based on your familiarity. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 ct for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many Arcanists keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

 </div>


{{note
##### Hiding a Spellbook
Arcanists learn quickly to hide their spellbooks, keeping one step
ahead of Templar searches. They might write them on scrolls hidden within hollowed-out walking sticks and weapons, sew each page between the cloth of their cloaks and clothing, or carve the symbols onto implements of wood and bone. The more daring or desperate may even tattoo their spells onto their own skin, trading subtlety for the confidence of always having power at their fingertips. For most, it is best to find a careful hiding spot (or several) wherever they make rest.

## Arcane Recovery
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Arcanist level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level Arcanist, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

## Arcane Masteries
When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane mastery, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight archetypes: Caller, Magus, Mesmer, Mirage, Necromancer, Prophet, Ravager, or Warder, each detailed in the following pages.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
\column

## Spell Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Arcanist spell and a 2nd-level Arcanist spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

## Signature Spells
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Arcanist spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## Caller
As a Caller, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances in an instant.


##### Conjuration Savant
Beginning when you select this mastery at 2nd level, the ceramic tokens and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

##### Minor Conjuration
Starting at 2nd level when you select this mastery, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet.

The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.

##### Benign Transposition
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.

##### Focused Conjuration
Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.


\column

{{note
##### The Limits of Conjuration

***Food and Drink.*** Despite what folk-lore the people of Athas might spread amongst themselves, Callers are not capable of creating nourishing food and drink from the aether. These items can certainly be conjured, and perhaps even consumed, but would be obvious fabrications and provide nothing of nourishment or hydration unless specified otherwise by a spell. 

Items created by magic in this manner are inherently magical, and while they may by all appearance and function appear as what they are duplicating, their essence remains false. 
}}

##### Durable Summons
Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.

## Magus
Magi, often pet weapons of the Sorcerer-Kings, see their magic as both weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. A Magus acts fast in battle, using their magic to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents“ attempts to counterattack. Magi are also adept at turning other spellcasters’ magical energy against them, a talent the Sorcerer-Kings value highly against their rivals. 

##### Arcane Deflection
At 2nd level, you have learned to weave your magic to fortify yourself against harm. When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw.

When you use this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.

##### Tactical Wit
Starting at 2nd level, your keen ability to assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier. 

##### Power Surge
Starting at 6th level, you can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells. In its stored form, this energy is called a power surge.

You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with *dispel magic* or *counterspell*, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with an Arcanist spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals half your Arcanist level.

##### Durable Magic
Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.

\column
::
##### Deflecting Shroud
At 14th level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused with deadly magic. When you use your Arcane Deflection feature, you can cause magical energy to arc from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal to half your Arcanist level.

## Mesmer
Mesmers practice the sorcery required to captivate and beguile other people and creatures. Some are pacifists seeking only to calm the mobs that ever wait on an Arcanist's heels, while others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most Mesmers fall somewhere in between, but rare are those who trust any Arcanist's discretion. 

##### Enchantment Savant
Beginning when you select this mastery at 2nd level, the ceramic tokens and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.

##### Hypnotic Gaze
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this mastery, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Arcanist spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.

Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

##### Instinctive Charm
Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack’s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Arcanist spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.

On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.

You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

##### Split Enchantment
Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.

\column
:
##### Alter Memories
At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed.

Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your Arcanist spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.

## Mirage
A Mirage's magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by their imaginations make the impossible seem real, bringing people's greatest hopes and horrors into reality. Some Mirages are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.

##### Illusion Savant
Beginning when you select this mastery at 2nd level, the ceramic tokens and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/LYs4BJB/Mirage-art.png' style='position:relative; top:70px; left:-120px; height:695px; width:480px;transform:scaleX(-1)' >

\column
:
##### Improved Minor Illusion
When you choose this mastery at 2nd level, you learn the *minor illusion* cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different Arcanist cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast *minor illusion*, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.

##### Malleable Illusions
Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell’s normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.

##### Illusory Self
Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Illusory Reality
By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic from the Black into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

## Necromancer
Necromancers draw upon the ashen haze of the Gray Plane to command the dread forces of life, death, and undeath. Manipulating the thin trails that tie all souls to Athas, you are able to sap the life force of living things even as your magic turns their bodies to dessicated corpses, transforming a foe to an ally through an utter corruption of its mortal form. 

Necromancy is the vilest of all arts in the eyes of Athasians, an inherent defilement that must be purged without question. Yet the magic is still practiced in some dark places of the world, passed from master to pupil in a tradition that persists in the hands of those who see greater ends by such means. 

##### Necromancy Savant
Beginning when you select this mastery at 2nd level, the ceramic tokens and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.

##### Grim Harvest
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the school of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.



##### Undead Thralls
At 6th level, you add the *animate dead* spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast *animate dead*, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.

When you create an undead using a necromancy spell, its hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your Arcanist level, and it adds your proficiency bonus to weapon damage rolls.

:::::::::

##### Inured to Undeath
Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.
 
\column
::

##### Command Undead
Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other Arcanists. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your Arcanist spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

## Prophet
The counsel of a Prophet is sought by Sorcerer-King and slave alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a Prophet, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. Not all will appreciate your insight-- but of course, you already knew that. 

##### Divination Savant
Beginning when you select this mastery at 2nd level, the ceramic tokens and time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved.

##### Portent
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this mastery, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

\column

##### Expert Divination
Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher than 5th level.

##### The Third Eye
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.

***Darkvision.*** You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in Chapter 7.



***Greater Comprehension.*** You can read any language.

***See Invisibility.*** You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.

##### Greater Portent
Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/m53bGW2/prophet.png' style='position:relative; top:460px; left:-600px; height:500px; width:450px;mix-blend-mode:multily' >

## Ravager
Ravagers focus their magic on powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Ravagers find employment in the armies of Sorcerer-Kings, serving as artillery to blast enemy fortifications from afar. Others use their spectacular power to seize territory of their own in the Bandit Wastes, or wage war against the Templars that hunt them. 

##### Evocation Savant
Beginning when you select this mastery at 2nd level, the ceramic tokens and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

##### Sculpt Spells
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

##### Potent Cantrip
Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

##### Empowered Evocation
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll of any Arcanist evocation spell you cast.

\column

##### Overchannel
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast an Arcanist spell of 5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/XkxZ5GC/ravager.png' style='position:relative; top:120px; left:-535px; height:900px; width:700px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Warder
Warders emphasize magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. In Athas, survival is often your most powerful weapon, and Warders ensure the survival of their charges against all threats. Whether banishing curses, shielding allies, or unraveling the ancient wards of lost ruins, Warders are invaluable to any who wish to live and fight another day. The best of them are in constant demand from those with pockets deep enough to ignore the stain of an Arcanist's presence, and many Warders find themselves curiously left out of the common prejudices levied towards other Arcanists. 

##### Abjuration Savant 
Beginning when you select this mastery at 2nd level, the ceramic tokens and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

##### Arcane Ward
Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your Arcanist level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

\column
::
While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.



##### Projected Ward
Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

##### Improved Abjuration
Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in *counterspell* and *dispel magic*), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.

##### Spell Resistance
Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.

Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.

# Barbarian

Barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the desert itself.

For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every Barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.


## Primal Instinct

People of the city-states and their client settlements take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a Barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature-- keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage.

Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the desert, jungle, or silt seas where their tribes live and hunt.

Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A Barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.

## A Life of Danger

Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the Barbarian class. A true Barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled Fighter in a town, and they play a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.

Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a Barbarian. Some Barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their war parties. 

\column

## Creating a Barbarian

When creating a Barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and their place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your Barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, your outsider perspective setting you apart from others in the Tablelands? Or do you hail from the gladiator pits and border settlements of the city-states, where savagery is an everyday reality?

What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.


<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Primal Paths
Rage burns in every Barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives them toward greatness. Different Barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, anger, or even psionics are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, the gift of a totem animal or elemental force.


* **Berserker.** Thrill in the blood-slick chaos of battle, heedless to your own mortality or exhaustion.

<br>

* **Flagellant.** Channel pain into power, denying death until it has first taken all who stand against you. 

<br>

- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells or manifest powers, you can’t cast, manifest, or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

## Unarmored Defense
While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.


## Reckless Attack
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.


## Danger Sense
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.


## Primal Knowledge
When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to Barbarians at 1st level.


## Primal Path
At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose one of five Primal Paths-- Berserker, Flagellant, Storm Herald, Totem Warrior, or Wild Will, each detailed on the following pages. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.


## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or  two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.


## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, when using the Attack action on your turn.


## Fast Movement
Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.


## Instinctive Pounce
Starting at 7th level, you can move up to half your speed as part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage.

\column

## Feral Instinct
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.



## Brutal Critical
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.


## Relentless Rage
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.


## Persistent Rage
Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.


## Indomitable Might
Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.


## Primal Champion
At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/HVPycw7/class-features-page-bottom-right.png' style='position:relative; top:630px; left:-355px; height:365px; width:330px; transform:scaleX(-1)' >

## Path of the Berserker
For some Barbarians, rage is merely a means to an end-- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the Berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.


##### Frenzy
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can enter a frenzy as a bonus action whilst you are raging. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns. You can make this attack as part of the same bonus action used to enter a frenzy, and you can enter a frenzy as part of the same bonus action used to enter a rage. 

If you enter a frenzy during your rage, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw when your rage ends. If you fail, you suffer one level of exhaustion. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 3. When you finish a long rest, the DC resets to 10. 

##### Mindless Rage
Beginning at 6th level, you ignore all effects of any levels of exhaustion you have whilst you are raging. 

Additionally, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

\column

##### Intimidating Presence
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use a bonus action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.


##### Gory Retribution
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within your reach, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

Additionally, your rage damage is doubled against that creature until the end of your next turn. 

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/y6JhxRR/better-berserker.png' style='position:relative; top:350px; left:-690px; height:655px; width:705px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Path of the Flagellant
Athas has turned the will of countless souls to ash and despair, but in the hearts of these Barbarians burns an unquenchable flame. Pain is the rasp of stone to the keen edge of their fervor, and blood is the ink by which their creed is penned. The Path of the Flagellant looks at all battles as a matter of will-- the strong shall outlast all others, and the weak will perish. 


##### Bloody Scorn
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, the first creature you hit with an attack on each of your turns while raging seeks vengeance against you. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.

::::::::::::::

##### Fight through the Pain
Starting at 6th level, the pain that fuels your rage protects you. If you fail a saving throw while raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.


##### Zealous Presence
At 10th level, your relentless disregard towards pain and risk inspires others to your example. As a bonus action, you unleash a howl rippling with feral rage. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.


##### Flames from the Ashes
By 14th level, your body can endure far beyond the point others would fall. 

While you’re raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious, cause you to become staggered, or force you to gain death points. Future damage still goes against your Vitality, however you cannot die due to Vitality damage until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points. Otherwise, you recover 1 point of Vitality when your rage ends and also gain 1 death point.  

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/HHZCDyf/Flagellant.png' style='position:relative; top:-70px; left:-180px; height:1050px; width:700px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Path of the Storm Herald
All Barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of elemental magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a Barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.

Storm Heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside Clerics, Druids, and others sworn to protect nature. Other Storm Heralds hone their craft in regions wracked by sandstorms, in the lost reaches of the silt seas at the edge of the known world, or deep in the hottest desert wastes.


##### Storm Aura
Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. 

Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose air, desert, or mountains. Your aura’s effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class. 

If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. 

***Air.*** When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level. 


***Desert.*** When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.


***Mountains.*** When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as earthen spirits inure them to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page



##### Storm Soul
At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn’t active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

***Air.*** You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you take half damage from falling.


***Desert.*** You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat as described in Chapter 7. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.


***Mountains.*** You gain resistance to force damage, and you gain advantage against effects that would knock you prone. Moreover, as an action, you can touch sand or silt and turn a 5 foot square of it into a solid, non-difficult terrain that can support any amount of weight for 1 minute.


##### Shielding Storm
At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.

\column


##### Raging Storm
At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

***Air.*** When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a gust. 


***Desert.*** Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half your Barbarian level.


***Mountains.*** Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical stone covers it.

## Path of the Totem Warrior
The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, where the Barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your Barbarian rage.

Most Barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.


##### Spirit Seeker
Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the *beast sense* and *speak with animals* spells, but only as rituals, as described in Chapter 9.



##### Totem Spirit
At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates the fur, feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. 

At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. 


***Crodlu.*** While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the crodlu makes you extraordinarily swift. 

***Dagorran.*** While you're raging, your allies have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the dagorran makes you a leader of hunters.

***Kes'trekel.*** While you're raging and aren’t wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the kes'trekel makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.

***Klar.*** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the klar makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

***Tigone.*** While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tigone empowers your leaps. 

\column
{{note
##### Animals of Athas
- **Crodlu.** A 10-12 foot tall flightless, scaled avian-like creature that roams the wilderness in herds.

<br>

- **Dagorran.** A fearsome frog-like reptilian pack hunter able to track prey psionically for days or weeks without relenting.

<br>

- **Kes'trekel.** A deadly carrion bird with black plumage and a crimson red head whose croak is considered a harbinger of death. 

<br>

- **Klar.** A massive bear with chitinous plate on the back, a stub tail that helps it balance when standing, and a hide covered in thick sandy fur. It is one of the most feared predators in the land.

<br>

- **Tigone.** A massive tiger with psionic abilities.


}} 

##### Aspect of the Beast
At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.


***Crodlu.*** Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated (see Chapter 7 for more information about travel pace). The crodlu spirit helps you roam far and fast.

***Dagorran.*** You gain the hunting sensibilities of a dagorran. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace (see Chapter 7 for rules on travel pace).

***Kes'trekel.*** You gain the eyesight of a kes'trekel. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.

***Klar.*** You gain the might of a klar. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.

***Tigone.*** You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The tigone spirit hones your survival instincts. 

##### Spirit Walker
At 10th level, you can cast the *commune with nature* spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

##### Totemic Attunement
At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.

***Crodlu.*** While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength bonus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone and take bludgeoning damage equal to ld12 + your Strength modifier.

***Dagorran.*** While you’re raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with a melee weapon attack.

\column
::
***Kes'trekel.*** While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

***Klar.*** While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.

***Tigone.*** While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.

## Path of the Wild Will

Many in Athas are considered Wild Talents- those born with psionic talents that manifest instinctually and uncontrollably. Some with greater power choose to walk the Way, practicing a lifetime of restraint and measured release- others never develop such control, becoming wandering maelstroms of raw psionic power that others call Barbarians of the Wild Will. 


##### Psionic Awareness
After taking this path at 3rd level, you can open your awareness to the presence of concentrated psionics as an action. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location or origin of any psionic power or item within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover. When you sense psionics, you learn which school of psionics they belong to.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

##### Wild Surge
When you choose this path at 3rd level, the psionic energy roiling inside you sometimes erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Will Effects table to determine the magical effect produced.

If the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

##### Bolstering Will
Starting at 6th level, you can harness your wild psionics to bolster yourself or a companion. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:

- For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll.

- Roll a d3. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals the number rolled or lower (the creature's choice). Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until after a long rest.

You can take this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
 
##### Unstable Backlash
Beginning at 10th level, your mind lashes out against attackers. Immediately after you take damage or fail a saving throw while raging, you can use your reaction to roll on the Wild Will Effects table and immediately produce the effect rolled. This effect replaces your current Wild Will effect.

\column
:

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Wild Will Effects
| d8  | Psionic Effect    |
|:----|:-----------------:|
| &nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | Torpor radiates around you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 psychic damage. You also gain 1d12 temporary hit points.                |
| &nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | You teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. Until your rage ends, you can use·this effect each turn as a bonus action.               |
| &nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | An intangible manifestation of your Will appears within 5 feet of one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. At the end of the current turn, the projection explodes, and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again and create another manifestation on each of your turns as a bonus action.                |
| &nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | You become hyperfocused on the weapon in your hand. Until your rage ends, the weapon's damage type changes to psychic, and it gains the light and thrown properties, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the weapon leaves your hand, the weapon reappears in your hand at the end of the current turn.                |
| &nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll before your rage ends, that creature takes 1d6 psychic damage as your mind lashes out.                |
| &nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | Until your rage ends, you are surrounded by a dense aura of psionic force; you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and while within 10 feet of you, your allies gain the same bonus.                |
| &nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | The matter at your feet begins to warp upon itself; until your rage ends, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies.                |
| &nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | A lance of spiking pain strikes out from you. One creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.                |
}}

::

##### Controlled Surge
Starting at 14th level, whenever you roll on the Wild Will Effects table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash. If both rolls are the same, ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.

# Cleric

The Clerics of Athas act as intermediaries between the decaying planet and the elemental powers warring over the scraps that remain. They do not pray to these forces, for the elements are not beings that give power in exchange for petty flattery-- they are neither benevolent nor malevolent, caring only that their natural forms are preserved in the material world. Clerics beneath the dark sun pledge themselves to the primordial aspects of sand, storm, sun--even, for those rare few able to forge such pacts, the rain itself. 

## Elemental Practices
Clerics do not generally congregate at temples or churches, nor do they participate in a uniform, organized religion. Each Cleric’s calling to the raw energy of the elements is personal, individual. Some Clerics believe that their rites of initiation draw the attention of elemental lords who grant them their powers- others believe the rites simply create a connection to the elements, a conduit by which they can channel such primordial forces. Whatever their beliefs, each Cleric is bound and sworn to preserve their patron element in the physical world. Few ever renounce the solemn agreement: to forsake the Pact is to incur the wrath of Athas itself.

## Wanderers and Heretics
Clerics are found everywhere on Athas. Most are wanderers, generally well received by the villagers and slave tribes of the deserts, who spread the message of preservation with the hope of restoring Athas. They teach crop rotation, cure the sick, and heal the wounded, sometimes even aiding in defeating local threats. Other Clerics act as wardens of small, hidden shrines, which they hope creates a clearer channel to the elemental plane they worship, fortifying their powers and spells. Tribal societies include shamans, who see to the spiritual needs of their groups. Lastly, some Clerics stay in the cities, where they defy the Sorcerer‐Kings and their Templars by teaching the citizenry of preservation, perhaps even working with the Veiled Alliance. 
 
## Creating a Cleric
When creating a Cleric character, think about what drew them to their element, what would inspire such devotion that all else would be sacrificed upon the altar of their lives. Were they lost in the wastes, forced to commune with the scorched desolation around them to survive? Or were they taught from a young age to believe in the hope for a restored Athas? Furthermore, how does their chosen element express itself through them?

## Spellcasting
As a conduit for elemental power, you can cast Cleric spells. See Chapter 9 for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 10 for the Cleric spell list.

### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. You learn additional Cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level Cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Ritual Casting
You can cast a Cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your Cleric spells.

{{note
##### Holy Symbols
An Athasian Cleric's holy symbol is a physical embodiment of your element. Earth clerics commonly use small chunks of granite, quartz, or precious metal, and those with resources may mount it in a staff or medallion. A water cleric likely has a vial of pure water worn around the neck, though a waterskin of untainted water could suffice. Fire clerics prefer obsidian stone, often carved into the shape of flames. Air clerics are not tied by material possessions, and may use a gentle puff of their own breath as a holy symbol.
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your element. You use your Wisdom whenever a Cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. 

In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

## Elemental Affinity
Choose one affinity matching your element: Air (also known as storm), Earth (sand), Fire (sun), and Water (rain). Each affinity is detailed on the following pages.


Your choice grants you affinity spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Affinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

### Affinity Spells
Each affinity has a list of spells—its affinity spells-- that you gain at the Cleric levels noted in the affinity description. Once you gain an affinity spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have an affinity spell that doesn’t appear on the Cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Cleric spell for you.

## Channel Affinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel energy directly from your element's realm, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your affinity. Some affinities grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the affinity description.

When you use your Channel Affinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Affinity again.

Some Channel Affinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your Cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Affinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

### Channel Affinity: Turn Undead
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a malediction censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

\column
:

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.


## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Destroy Undead
Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Cleric Level  | Destroys Undead of CR... |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  5th  | 1/2 or lower |
|  8th  | 1 or lower|
|  11th  | 2 or lower |
|  14th  | 3 or lower |
|  17th  | 4 or lower|
}}


## Elemental Intervention
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your element to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. You must use an action to describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your element intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric affinity spell would be appropriate.

If your element intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

## Air 

Clerics who find affinity with the element of Air are perhaps the most misunderstood of all the elemental clerics. They are wanderers, diviners, travelers, and priests. Like the winds, their minds are constantly wandering, and they rarely seem focused on a current problem or situation. 

Air Clerics prize freedom over all. They loathe restriction in movement, personalities, beliefs, practices, clothing, and any attempt to impose limitations. This makes them enemies of bondage and slavery. The growing power of the sun has made the air angry, dry, and lifeless, unable to power hurricanes and typhoons. Air Clerics are obligated to protect earth and water in the hopes mighty forests might sway again and raging oceans fill the silt basins, bringing back unbridled freedom. 


{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Air Affinity Spells
| Cleric Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1st  | *fog cloud, thunderwave* |
|  3rd  | *gust of wind, shatter*|
|  5th  | *call lightning, gaseous form* |
|  7th  | *storm sphere, summon elemental (air only)* |
|  9th  | *destruction wave, control winds*|
}}
### Raging Winds
At 1st level you are imbued with the fury and persistence of the battering winds. This grants several benefits:

* You gain proficiency with martial weapons.
* You learn the *gust* or *thunderclap* cantrip, your choice. The cantrip you selected counts as a Cleric cantrip for you and doesn’t count against the number of Cleric cantrips you know. 
* When you use your Turn Undead channel affinity, you can also effect non-air elementals.



### Wrath of the Storm
Also at 1st level, you can thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. 

The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


\column
::

{{note
##### Air Initiation
The test of the Air Cleric is perhaps the most terrifying of the elemental initiations. A Cleric and their mentor meditate for up to two weeks atop the highest mountain they can find. When they feel ready, the initiate walks to a ledge and leaps from the precipice, throwing off the shackles of the earth and giving themselves completely to the wind. As they fall, the air spirits may speak with them and forge a pact of air, lowering them softly to the ground. If not, they likely die.
}}

### Channel Affinity: Thundercrack
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Affinity to wield the power of the storm with unchecked ferocity.

When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Affinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.

### Thunderbolt Strike
At 6th level, when you deal lightning damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

### Blessed Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your attacks with elemental energy. Once on each of your turns when a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Stormborn
At 17th level, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed whenever you are not underground or indoors.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/yyBmdd8/Air-Element.png' style='position:relative; top:625px; left:-360px; height:350px; width:350px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Earth 

Closely tied to nature, Earth Clerics understand the true nature of the cycle of life. When something dies, its organic material is returned to the soil to provide life for another, and in another form. Therefore, the Earth Cleric's outlook on life is a utilitarian one. The death of a comrade, though tragic, is simply one stage in nature’s endless chain of creation and annihilation. 

Because air, fire, and water all depend on growing things for their enrichment, while earth alone must sustain itself, it is the Earth Clerics who must carry on the burden of preventing the environmental holocaust looming over Athas, such as teaching proper agricultural techniques and slaying defilers who would turn usable elements to ash. For, if they do not preserve the land, will not the death of Athas weigh upon their shoulders?

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Earth Affinity Spells
| Cleric Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1st  | *earth tremor, longstrider* |
|  3rd  | *earthbind, dust devil*|
|  5th  | *earthen grasp, wall of sand* |
|  7th  | *stoneskin, summon elemental (earth only)* |
|  9th  | *transmute rock, wall of stone*|
}}

### Mountain's Resilience

At 1st level you are imbued with the strength and fortitude of the earth. This grants several benefits:

* You gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.
* Your hit points maximum increases by 1, and it increases by one every time you gain a level. 
* You learn the *mold earth* or *magic stone* cantrip, your choice. The cantrip you selected counts as a Cleric cantrip for you and doesn’t count against the number of Cleric cantrips you know.
* When you use your Turn Undead channel affinity, you can also effect non-earth elementals.

### Channel Affinity: Unstoppable

At 2nd level, the Cleric may use their Channel Affinity as a reaction when struck by any effect that causes them to become paralyzed, prone, or restrained, or when affected by any force or ability that would move them against their will. The Cleric immediately shakes off the effect as if it never happened.


\column
::

{{note
##### Earth Initiation
When a mentor believes that a disciple is ready, after meditation, the initiate is buried alive in a fertile land at dawn and must commune with the spirits of the earth to sustain themselves. When the sun goes down, the novice either emerges, unscathed and empowered, or likely dies and feeds the earth.
}}

### Stone Ward
At 6th level, you gain the ability to impart the sturdiness of the earth to those around you. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Blessed Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your attacks with earthen energy. Once on each of your turns when a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type first dealt to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Avatar of the Earth
At 17th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/qyDWdhW/Earth-Element.png' style='position:relative; top:590px; left:-395px; height:400px; width:400px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Fire

Fire is the feared domain of destructive power, rarely seen as nurturing and life-giving. Yet, fire wipes away the old so the land can grow back stronger.   Most Fire Clerics are impulsive and destructive like their element, and seen as madmen who randomly destroy precious organic material. They sometimes jest “to destroy the world is to destroy the defilers,” and no one is quite sure if they are truly joking. 

Fire Clerics are expected to preserve Athas so it can be destroyed again and grow back stronger. They encourage the growth of forests, cities, and fields. This pact leads them to directly oppose all defilers and Sorcerer-Kings, but their ways are too eccentric to form lasting alliances with Druids, who share the same goal.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Fire Affinity Spells
| Cleric Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1st  | *burning hands, faerie fire* |
|  3rd  | *flaming sphere, scorching ray*|
|  5th  | *daylight, fireball* |
|  7th  | *summon elemental (fire only), wall of fire* |
|  9th  | *flame strike, scrying*|
}}

### Fire's Fury
At 1st level you are imbued with the power and ferocity of the flame. This grants several benefits:

* You gain either the *produce flame* or *control flames* cantrip. The cantrip you selected counts as a Cleric cantrip for you and doesn’t count against the number of Cleric cantrips you know. 
* When you use your Turn Undead channel affinity, you can also effect non-fire elementals.

### Warding Flare
Also at 1st level, you can interpose elemental light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be blinded is immune to this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Affinity: Sunburst
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Affinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.

\column
::

{{note
##### Fire Initiation
When a mentor feels their student is ready, they take the initiate to a clearing and burn them in a massive bonfire at nightfall. If accepted, the novice remains in the inferno through the night as it burns and infuses them with flame. Their hair, if any, turns fiery red and their eyes coal black, known as “the badge of flame.” If not accepted, they are consumed as mere kindling to the elements. 
}}




 {{width:7px}} As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your Cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

### Improved Flare
Starting at 6th level, you can also use Warding Flare when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature other than you.

### Blessed Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your attacks with elemental energy. Once on each of your turns when a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Corona of Light
Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.

## Water
Water is the rarest of elements, life-giving and life-taking, with a severe and unforgiving animosity to any who would defile a well or plants. Water Clerics instinctively sense a duty to perform an age-old function of being healer and bringer of life regardless of the morals of the target, and they bear a sadness to the moisture that has been lost by defilement. Some eventually go insane, consumed by their inability to quench the thirst of this land.

They worship by finding the dew of the morning and encouraging it, or keeping lifeblood from needlessly spilling onto barren land (if it falls on fertile land, that is another matter). Because water can be found in all living things, they have access to powers that can restore, or manipulate, beings.

|  3rd  | *lesser restoration, misty step*|

|  9th  | *cone of cold, maelstrom*|
}}



### Disciple of the Oasis
Also at 1st level you are imbued with the life giving power of water. This grants several benefits:

* You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. If you already have a swimming speed, it instead increases by 10 feet.
* When you cast a spell that creates water, you produce double the amount you normally would.
* Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore HP, the creature regains additional HP equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
* You learn the *shape water* or *ray of frost* cantrip, your choice. The cantrip you selected counts as a Cleric cantrip for you and doesn’t count against the number of Cleric cantrips you know.
* When you use your Turn Undead channel affinity, you can also effect non-water elementals.

### Channel Affinity: Preserve Life
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Affinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature 

\column
::
can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

{{note
##### Water Initiation
When a mentor feels a student is ready, they begin the long journey to a rare body of water such as Lake Island or the Lake of the Golden Dreams. For a day they meditate on the lake’s edge, and at dusk, the student enters the water and surrenders to the depths. If accepted, the initiate spends the night in the dark water forging a pact with babbling spirits. If not, the student likely drowns.
}}

### Dampen Elements
Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage. If it is acid or other water related damage, you or the creature take no damage.

### Blessed Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your attacks with elemental energy. Once on each of your turns when a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Supreme Healing
Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

# Crusader
The Crusaders of Athas live only for their vows, the binding allegiances which grant them powers great and terrible in exchange for unflinching devotion and tireless service. Tread carefully among zealots-- one man's gallant guardian is another's butcher. 




## Servants to Slaughter
These dread knights are often indoctrinated early in the tenets of war and vow alike, whether fostered as foundlings by the Templars of Sorcerer-Kings or raised as revolutionaries against the city-states' tyranny. Others are molded by their own callings, seeking glory or vengeance with a single-minded determination that pushes them to fanatical extremes.

No matter what banner they march under, Crusaders serve missions of death. Others' at first, for the forces of Athas do not bend lightly, and eventually their own, for even the strongest wills find their strength weakening under the scars of age and battle.

## Feared and Honored

Crusaders are viewed with suspicion by most upon arrival. There's no telling the target of their crusade by sight alone, nor how many bystanders might find themselves cut down as collateral damage. The daring and desperate might risk drawing a Crusader's attention for the chance of aid, but it's far more likely to see all conversation evaporate the moment they enter the room. 

Moreover, it's well known that most Crusaders the common folk might encounter will be in service of the Sorcerer-Kings. Unlike the Templars, whose greed and ambition can be relied upon for more creative interpretations of city-state law, Crusaders must follow it exactly or risk losing everything by breaking their vow. 
 
## Creating a Crusader
When creating a Crusader character, there are two important questions to consider -- what mission have you dedicated your life to, and why? 

Depending on the vow you choose, your Crusader could be a rebel champion shining bright against the backdrop of this dark world, an indoctrinated solider in the Sorcerer-King's armies, or anything in between. Perhaps you've never even had formal training in war or power, but ride forth into the wasteland purely on will and determination after everything else was stolen from you. 

Determining what the turning point of your character's life was-- the moment that put them onto this path forevermore, for better or worse-- will form the foundation of your Crusader's entire belief system and driving motivations. 


  
\column

<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Crusader Vows
A Crusader's vows are the source of all their power, the unwavering tenets which guide every action. 


* **Vow of Conquest.** Slay and seize all the world before you, letting none limit your dominion.

<br>

* **Vow of the Crown.** Crush the enemies of your King and enforce their laws upon the masses. 

<br>

* **Vow of Glory.** Shy from no trial, hide no trophy, and forge your legend in boasts and bloodshed.

<br>

* **Vow of the Preserver.** Cleanse the Sorcerer-Kings' corruption from Athas and restore what was lost. 

<br>

* **Vow of Vengeance.** What was done cannot be forgiven, nor forgotten. See that the price is paid.

## Sorcerous Sense
The presence of strong magic appears to you as an illuminated haze. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any elemental, monstrosity, or undead creature within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been defiled. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

## Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your Crusader level x 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
## Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t stack the effects of a Fighting Style option, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Blind Fighting
You have blind sight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

#### Defense
While wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target other than you within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0). You must be wielding a simple or martial weapon or a shield to use this reaction.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

#### Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to  the damage roll.

#### Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

## Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on arcane magic through meditation and incantation to cast spells. See Chapter 9 for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 10 for the Crusader spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Crusader table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your Crusader spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 

You prepare the list of Crusader spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Crusader spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Crusader spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your Crusader level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level Crusader, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Crusader spells requires time spent in meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Crusader spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Crusader spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol (found in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Crusader spells.




{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Sorcerous Smite
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one Crusader spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or an elemental.

## Arcane Fortitude
By 3rd level, the magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

## Binding Vow
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the vow that binds you as a Crusader forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Vow of Conquest, the Vow of the Crown, the Vow of Glory, the Vow of the Preserver, or the Vow of Vengeance, each detailed in the following pages. 

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include vow spells and the Channel Vow feature.

#### Vow Spells
Each vow has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the vow description. Once you gain access to a vow spell, you always have it prepared. Vow spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain a vow spell that doesn’t appear on the Crusader spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Crusader spell for you.


#### Channel Vow
Your vow allows you to channel energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Vow option provided by your vow explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Vow, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Vow again.

Some Channel Vow effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your Crusader spell save DC.


## Harness Power
When you reach 3rd level, you can expend a use of your Channel Vow to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice.

You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


\column

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or  two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Martial Versatility
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to Crusaders. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Aura of Protection
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.


## Aura of Courage
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

## Improved Sorcerous Smite
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry magical power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Sorcerous Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Sorcerous Smite.

## Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\page

## Vow of Conquest
The Vow of Conquest calls to Crusaders who seek the favor of their Sorcerer-King by securing new lands and subjugating any who would question their reign. Sometimes called knight--tyrants, those who swear this vow often form war bands that venture out to destroy threats along the city-state borders or demand tribute from passing tribes. Many adorn their armor with trophies from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them or the decrees of their sovereigns. 

##### Tenets of Conquest
A Crusader who takes this vow has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm. 

***Douse the Flame of Hope.*** It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire. 

***Rule with an Iron Fist.*** Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow.

***Strength Above All.*** You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin.

##### Vow Spells
You gain vow spells at the Crusader level listed.
{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Crusader Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd | *armor of Sielba, command* |
|  5th | *hold person, spiritual weapon*|
|  9th  | *bestow curse, fear* |
|  13th  | *dominate beast, stoneskin* |
|  17th  | *cloudkill, dominate person*|
}}
##### Channel Vow
When you take this vow at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Vow options.

***Conquering Presence.*** You can use your Channel Vow to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Guided Strike.*** You can use your Channel Vow to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Vow to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses. 

\column

##### Aura of Conquest
Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you’re not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your Crusader level if it starts its turn there.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.


##### Scornful Rebuke
Starting at 15th level, those who dare to strike you are  punished for their audacity. Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you're not incapacitated.


##### Invincible Conqueror
At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute: 
- You have resistance to all damage. 
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action. 
- Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/bvtdx2N/Conquest.jpg' style='position:relative; top:500px; left:-375px; height:480px; width:400px;mix-blend-mode:multiply;transform:scaleX(-1)' >

\page
## Vow of the Crown
The Vow of the Crown is a commitment to the Sorcerer-Kings' laws, often taken by Crusaders serving as shock troops for the nobles and Templars of a city-state. They are the ultimate enforcers, acting as judge, jury, and executioner to any who work against the rule of law and order. 

##### Tenets of the Crown
The tenets of this vow vary depending on the Sorcerer-King, but generally emphasize:

***Law.*** The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds civilization together, and must be respected.

***Loyalty.*** Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.

***Courage.*** You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds or anguished morality. 

***Responsibility.*** You are subject to the same laws as any citizen, and suffer the same consequences.

##### Vow Spells
You gain vow spells at the Crusader level listed.
{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Crusader Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd | *command, compelled duel* |
|  5th | *warding bond, zone of truth*|
|  9th  | *aura of vitality, spirit guardians* |
|  13th  | *banishment, guardian of faith* |
|  17th  | *circle of power, geas*|
}}
##### Channel Vow
When you take this vow at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Vow options.

***Champion Challenge.*** You issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet away from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die, or if the creature is moved more than 30 feet away from you.

***Turn the Faithless.*** You use your Channel Vow as an action to utter ancient curses that defile the earth, forcing each elemental or plant within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to flee from you, and cannot take reactions or willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

If the creature’s true form is concealed, that form is revealed while it is turned.

##### Sorcerous Allegiance
Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take the blow, causing any damage the creature would suffer to be dealt to you instead.  This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. 


##### Unyielding Spirit
At 15th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned. 


##### Exalted Champion
At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to your allies. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour: 

- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
- Your allies can fight on at 0 Hit Points without becoming staggered, but still take 1  Death Point.
- You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/mFnQtb3/Crown.png' style='position:relative; top:334px; left:-440px; height:675px; width:510px;mix-blend-mode:multiply;' >

## Vow of Glory
Crusaders who take the Vow of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions so they're all ready when destiny calls. These Crusaders might be aligned with an organization whose goals support their own, or they may be independent adventurers seeking to blaze a new trail across Athas. 

##### Tenets of Glory
The tenets of the Vow of Glory drive a Crusader to attempt heroics that might one day shine in legend.

***Actions over Words.*** Strive to be known by glorious deeds, not words.

***Challenges Are but Tests.*** Face hardships with courage, and encourage your allies to face them with you.

***Hone the Body.*** Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.

***Discipline the Soul.*** You must marshal the discipline to overcome failings within yourself that threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.

##### Vow Spells
You gain vow spells at the Crusader level listed.
{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Crusader Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd | *guiding bolt, heroism* |
|  5th | *enhance ability, magic weapon*|
|  9th  | *haste, protection from energy* |
|  13th  | *compulsion, freedom of movement* |
|  17th  | *commune, flame strike*|
}}

##### Channel Vow
You gain the following two Channel Vow options.

***Peerless Athlete.*** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Vow to augment your athleticism. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).

***Inspiring Smite.*** Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Sorcerous Smite feature, you can use your Channel Vow as a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

\column
::
##### Aura of Alacrity
Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura that fills you and your companions with supernatural speed, allowing you to race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't incapacitated, the walking speed of any ally who starts their turn within 10 feet of you increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 30 feet.


##### Glorious Defense
At 15th level, you can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


##### Living Legend
Upon reaching 20th level, you can empower yourself with the legends--whether true or exaggerated-- of your great deeds.

As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.
- Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.
- If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

## Vow of the Preserver
The Vow of the Preserver is perhaps the most dangerous of all, and the only one to denounce the Sorcerer-Kings outright. Crusaders who take this vow are most often found among Seedling tribes or Veiled Alliance auxiliaries, for few others could speak such criticisms without fear of swift and fatal reprisal. They live off the land, and never stay in settled places for longer than is necessary.  Sometimes called green knights, Crusaders who swear this vow proclaim their faith in the old ways of preservation, hoping to retain what is left of Athas and willing to destroy any who would defile it further. They do so not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor or justice, but because it is the only way anyone shall survive this scorched wasteland. Subtle touches of natural elements are often seen in their armament, such as hardy scrubgrass or desert flowers- anything to show that there is yet hope and life beyond the Defilers' atrocities.  

#### Tenets of the Preserver
The tenets of the Vow of the Preserver have been protected for uncounted centuries. This vow emphasizes the principles of preservation above any concerns of law or self-interest. The three central principles are simple.

***Grow the Green.*** In any possible opportunity, foster the growth of the natural world, whether by the planting of a seed or the defense of a Druid. Where you find open minds, teach them of preservation and the abominable consequences of defilement. 

***Shelter the Hope.*** Where there is good, love, and hope in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren. 

***Preserve your Light.*** The Sorcerer-Kings would drown you in darkness, and leave the hope of preservation to wilt and perish in silence. Do whatever is necessary to survive in this war, for there are too few of your kind to throw your life away over pride or vanity. 


##### Vow Spells
You gain vow spells at the Crusader level listed.
{{classTable,frame,decoration

##### Channel Vow
When you take this vow at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Vow options.

***Nature’s Wrath.*** You can use your Channel Vow to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.

***Turn the Tide.*** As a bonus action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Vow. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its hit points. 

##### Sylvantongue

Preservers have developed secret symbols and hand gestures to communicate with other allies should they encounter by chance. You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.


##### Aura of Warding
Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms a protective ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.


##### Undying Sentinel
Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page


##### Green Champion
At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.

Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
- At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.
- Whenever you cast a Crusader spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.
- Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your Crusader spells and Channel Vow options.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Vow of Vengeance
The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When raiding Elvhen slaughter helpless villagers, when a Defiler destroys one of the last natural spaces, when the Veiled Alliance bombs a Templar headquarters, when a Sorcerer-King massacres a wandering tribe, when someone's family is condemned to slavery for invented crimes-- at times like these, Crusaders arise and swear a Vow of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these Crusaders— sometimes called justicars—their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.


##### Tenets of Vengeance
The tenets of the Vow of Vengeance vary by Crusader, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Crusaders who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the Crusaders are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.

***Fight the Greater Evil.*** Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.

***No Mercy for the Wicked.*** Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

***By Any Means Necessary.*** Moral qualms cannot interfere with the extermination of my foes.

***Restitution.*** If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.

##### Vow Spells
You gain vow spells at the Crusader level listed.

|  3rd | *bane, hunter’s mark* |

|  17th  | *hold monster, scrying*|
}}

\column
##### Channel Vow
When you take this vow at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Vow options.

***Abjure Enemy.*** As an action, you present your holy symbol and declare an edict of eradication, using your Channel Vow. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Beasts and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.

On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

***Vow of Enmity.*** As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Vow. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.


##### Relentless Avenger
By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.


##### Soul of Vengeance
Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.


##### Avatar of Vengeance
At 20th level, you draw upon your power so strongly it transforms you into something of awe and terror. Using your action, you undergo ascension. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:
- Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.
- You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Druid
The Druids of Athas are solitary creatures. They live off the land, within the land, and they have sacrificed their entire lives for the land. But, unlike Clerics, Druids concentrate their considerable abilities in a single area: their guarded lands. A barren stretch of desert, a sparse section of scrub land, or perhaps a sparkling oasis, that is the home of the Druid, and their source of power. One small preserve, protected at all costs from the dark magic of the defilers.

They are the bane of Sorcerer-Kings, eternally at war with them, but hunted to small enough numbers to no longer be considered a viable threat. The few Druids bide their time, training and rebuilding their ranks. It is said that one day the Druids will rise from the earth with their fallen preservers and erase the Sorcerer-Kings from Athas.

## Trance of the Initiate
Unlike Clerics, Druids are not bound to the elements' demands but are instead tasked with defending the raw elements of Athas itself. They do not undergo rites of initiation but instead apprentice under other Druids. Months may pass before a mentor believes the initiate is ready to speak with the elements. At that time, the student is allowed to commune in a deep trance with the spirits. There are very few rejections as Druids tend to carefully weed and groom candidates before ever allowing them to commune. To fail is to be taken by the elements, split four ways and returned to the earth.

## Creating a Druid
Druids are defined by the lands they protect. Choose one specific geographic feature to be your Guarded Land. This may be a particular stretch of desert, an oasis, a cave, a belt of scrub grass, and so on. While you are within the boundaries of your Guarded Land, you are under a constant *pass without trace* effect and can cast *speak with animals* and *speak to plants* at will. When you are a 7th level Druid, you no longer need to eat or drink while in your guarded land.

Some possible guarded lands for the element of Earth include a particular mountain or hill, a rocky outcropping, or an expanse of steppes. For the element of Air, a Druid might opt to protect the sky over a particular area, the winds of a canyon, or any prevailing wind pattern. For the element of Fire, dry grasslands, a volcanic vent, hot springs, or boiling tar pits are appropriate guardian lands. Lastly, the element of Water might include a spring or pool, an oasis, or a natural cistern. 
 


  
\column

<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Druidic Circles
To say the Druids of Athas have circles pays homage to a lost era, for present-day Druids are more often than not lonely hermits desperately seeking to pass down their arts before all knowledge dwindles away. 


* **Circle of the Land.** Keepers of forbidden lore.

<br>

* **Circle of the Moon.** Solitary shapeshifters.

<br>

* **Circle of the Sands.** Sentient sandstorms. 

<br>


* **Circle of the Shepherd.** Protectors to wildlife. 

<br>


* **Circle of Spores.** Devotees to decomposition.

## Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

## Spellcasting
Drawing on the essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See Chapter 9 for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 10 for the Druid spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. You learn additional Druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

\column

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a Druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus (found in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Druid spells.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level Druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Druid spells requires  at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.


{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page


## Wild Shape
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any non-flying or swimming beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Beast Shapes
| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                | Example |
|:----  |:-------:|:--------------------------:|:-------:|
| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed|Rasclinn |
| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed            |Erdlu    |
| 8th   | 1       | --                         |Dagorran |
}}
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

## Druid Circle
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of Druids: the Circle of the Land, the Circle of the Moon, the Circle of the Shepherd, the Circle of the Sands, or the Circle of Spores, each detailed in the following pages. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

## Wild Companion
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the *find familiar* spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your Druid level.


## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Timeless Body
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

## Beast Spells
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your Druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a Druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.

{{note
##### The Laws of Nature
While using Wild Shape, the following rules apply:
- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you, use the higher bonus. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
:
- When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.  As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
:
- You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or perform actions requiring hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you’ve already cast.
:
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
:
- Your equipment must either fall to the ground in your space, merge into your new form, or be worn by your new form if possible. Worn equipment functions as normal, but does not change size or shape. Any merged equipment has no effect until you leave the new form. 
}}



## Archdruid
At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your Druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.


{{pageNumber,auto}}

## Circle of the Land
The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.

##### Circle Spells
Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a Druid. Choose that land— cave, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, oasis, or swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the Druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Druid spell for you.

##### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional Druid cantrip of your choice.

##### Natural Recovery
Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level Druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. 


##### Land's Stride
Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell.

##### Nature's Ward
When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.


##### Nature's Sanctuary
When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

## Circle of the Moon
Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another Druid.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a tigone one night, soar over the desert as a kes'trekel the next day, and crash through the Ringing Mountains' undergrowth in klar form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid's blood.

##### Combat Wild Shape
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

##### Circle Forms
The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your Druid level divided by 3, rounded down.


##### Primal Strike
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. 


##### Elemental Wild Shape
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into a Shaped Elemental of air, earth, fire, or water, each found within the Athasian Bestiary. 


##### Thousand Forms
By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the *alter self* spell at will.

## Circle of the Sands
Druids that enter the Circle of the Sands strive to protect the seemingly barren deserts of the world. They understand that deserts have their own ecosystems and life cycles that need to be preserved from the encroachment of the civilized worlds.

##### Circle Spells
Your link to the desert and your affinity towards the sandy dunes grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Sands Spells table. 

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Druid spell for you.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Circle of the Sands Spells
| Druid Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  2nd | *earth tremor* |
|  3rd | *earthen grasp*|
|  5th  | *wall of sand* |
|  7th  | *stone shape* |
|  9th  | *transmute rock*|
}}
##### Sand Form
Starting at 2nd level, you learn how to transform your body into living sand. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a form of sand, rather than transforming into a beast. 

While in your sand form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes a collection of sand and dust that loosely resembles your natural form. This form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your sand form, you gain the following characteristics:

- You are immune to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions.
- You can enter and occupy the space of another creature.
- You do not need to breathe.
- You can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, but you treat liquids as though they were solid surfaces. 


##### Earthen Resilience
Upon reaching 6th level, you become resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage whenever you assume your sand form. If a creature of Medium size or smaller ends its turn inside the same space as you, it is considered to be suffocating until it leaves the space you occupy. 


##### Sand Storm
At 10th level, you can create a magical sandstorm. As an action while in your sand form, you can conjure a 20-foot radius whirlwind of sand and dust that remains centered on you for one minute. 

Creatures other than you inside this sandstorm make all attacks, Dexterity saving throws, and Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks based on sight with disadvantage. 

You must concentrate on this effect as if it was a spell. It ends early if you dismiss it or your sand form (no action required), are incapacitated, or die.

You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again. 


##### Dust Behemoth
Starting at 14th level, your sand form becomes more powerful. While in an area that has loose sand such as a desert or sandy beach, you can increase your size category by one when entering your sandy form. This also increases the range of your Sand Storm ability by 5 feet.

Additionally, while in your sandy form, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

## Circle of the Shepherd
Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These Druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. 

Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to fey spirits. Many of these Druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.

Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these Druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.

##### Speech of the Woods
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and fey spirits.

You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn’t grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.

\column

##### Spirit Totem
Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.

As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see. 

The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. The effect of the spirit’s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

- ***Kes'trekel Totem.*** The kes'trekel spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.

- ***Klar Totem.*** The klar spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your Druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura. 

- ***Spirit of the Land Totem.*** A Spirit of the Land is an enigmatic force that infuses particular lands. Only a select few Druids know how to tap into the energies of these silent, ancient powers. 

  The spirit of the land lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your Druid level.

<!-- Use --offset to shift the mask away from page center (can use cm instead of %)

\page

##### Mighty Summoner
Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you summon are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits: 
- The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has, or level of the spell used to summon it, whichever is greater.
- The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.

##### Guardian Spirit
Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your Druid level.

##### Faithful Summons
Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower are summoned to your side. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. 

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/NFwgGR8/shepherd.jpg' style='position:relative; top:-10px; left:-105px; height:1000px; width:530px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Circle of Spores
Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These Druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these Druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.


##### Circle Spells
Starting at 2nd level, your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. 

At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Druid spell for you.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Circle of Spores
| Druid Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  2nd | *chill touch* |
|  3rd | *blindness/deafness, gentle repose*|
|  5th  | *animate dead, gaseous form* |
|  7th  | *blight, confusion* |
|  9th  | *cloudkill, contagion*|
}}

##### Halo of Spores
Upon reaching 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

\column

##### Symbiotic Entity
Beginning at 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

- When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra ld6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.


##### Fungal Infestation
At 6th level, your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the Zombie stat block in the Athasian Bestiary. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.


##### Spreading Spores
At 10th level, you gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active.

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.

While the cube of spores persists, you can't use your Halo of Spores reaction.

##### Fungal Body
When you reach 14th level, the fungal spores in your body alter you: you can't be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, unless you're incapacitated.

# Empath

Empaths are mentors, therapists, and spiritual guides who realize their psionic potential through intuition and emotion. The nature of reality is often debated, and the Empath uses this very debate as evidence of their own philosophy: Belief shapes reality. One does not see an object, one only sees a reflection of light bouncing off an object and believes it to still be there. Likewise, one can never really know another person, only believe in them or not. Belief is the cornerstone of all existence, and if one believes in something strongly enough, it becomes reality. Thus, the Empath channels their belief into psionic power.

## Guided Meditation
Empaths use their psionic abilities to aid and protect their allies and friends. Their transcendental understanding of the mind and its place in the cosmos grants them the ability to influence emotions, heal wounds, impart knowledge, and even reshape reality. An Empath might recite confusing koans or pepper their speech with vague, esoteric terms that their companions don’t fully understand, but their usefulness cannot be denied.

## Heart on your Sleeve
An Empath understands the cosmos and their place in it in terms of feelings rather than facts. Though psionic power stems from the mind, the Empath channels this power through their heart. Logic and deduction, while important, reveal less truth to an Empath than how they feel about a topic. To an Empath, one can be technically correct, but still lose an argument because of how it was argued. Thus, the Empath seeks to resolve conflicts by appealing to emotions rather than cold, rational logic, either by using words or their psionic abilities.

## Creating an Empath
When creating an Empath consider your personal philosophy. Is all the world a dream? Is every living thing connected, part of a greater whole? Where did you learn this philosophy, or did you develop it on your own? Did your psionic powers come before your philosophical outlook, driving you to find the answers to life’s questions in order to explain your psionic potential? Or were your mental abilities the product of meditating on your understanding of the cosmos and attaining enlightenment?

\column

<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Empathic Mantles
Every Empath pursues a particular path by which they use their
psionic abilities to understand the cosmos, taking on a mantle that
describes their philosophy.

* **Mystic.** Guide your companions with beneficial auras and enhanced healing.

<br>

* **Occultist.** Seek knowledge from psychic impressions and spirits.

<br>

* **Wilder.** Unleash your emotions to debilitate your foes and channel psychic power into your attacks.

## Psionics
You realize your psionic potential, gaining the use of talents and augments, the rules for which appear in Chapter 11. Psionic powers are magical effects.


### Psionic Talents
A psionic talent is a psionic power that is a cantrip spell. You know three psionic talents of your choice from the Empath talent list found later in this class description, plus a bonus psionic talent determined by your choice of empathic mantle (see Mantle Powers later in this section). You learn additional Empath talents of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Talents Known column of the Empath table.



### Augments
An augment is a psionic power that augments a psionic talent. You must be focusing on an augment’s corresponding psionic talent in order to manifest it. You know five 1st-level powers that augment the Empath talents you know.

The Augments Known column of the Empath table shows when you learn more augments of your choice. When the table indicates that you learn a new augment, you may only choose a power that augments one of the Empath talents you know. Each of these augments must have a minimum power level no greater than half your levels in this class when you learn them (round up).

For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn one new psionic power that augments an Empath talent you know, and the power can be up to 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose to replace one of your existing powers that augments an Empath talent you know and replace it with another power that augments any Empath talent you know. The new power can have a minimum power level no greater than half your levels in this class when you learn them (round up).


### Psi Points
You have an internal reservoir of psionic energy represented by psi points. You must spend psi points from this reserve to manifest a power that augments a psionic talent.

The number of psi points you have is based on your Empath level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Empath table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. When expending psi points to manifest an augment, you cannot reduce your current psi points to below 0. Your psi point total returns to your maximum when you finish a long rest.
<br>


### Psi Limit
Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit to the number of psi points you can spend to manifest a power that augments a psionic talent. The limit is based on your Empath level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Empath table. For example, as a 3rd-
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
level Empath, you can spend no more than 4 psi points when manifesting an augment, no matter how many psi points you have.
<br>

### Psionic Ability
Wisdom is your psionic ability for your Empath powers. You use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic power or when making an attack roll with one.

<br>

## Empathic Mantle
Choose one of the following mantles: Mystic, Occultist, or Wilder. Your choice grants you mantle powers and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional features at 3rd, 6th, and 14th level.

### Mantle Powers
Each mantle has a psionic talent and list of augments –mantle powers– that you learn at the Empath levels noted in the mantle description. Mantle powers do not count against the number of Empath talents or augments you know.

## Focused Defense
While you are focusing on a psionic talent and are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

## Enlightnment
Beginning at 2nd level, you can guide another creature through meditation and unlock their full potential. To do so, you and one other creature within 5 feet of you must remain still, without moving or taking any action and concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell) for 1 minute. If both you and the target remain still and concentrate for the full duration, the target may then add double their proficiency bonus to all ability checks with one skill or one tool they are already proficient in, instead of their normal proficiency bonus.

This effect lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest. You may use this feature once, and must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

Beginning at 10th level, you may use this feature twice between rests, and, beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Sublime Power
At 11th level, you gain the ability to glimpse eternity and briefly increase your psi limit. As a bonus action, you increase your psi limit by 2 for the next power you manifest before the end of your next turn. You may use this feature once, and must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

The amount you increase your psi limit by grows when you reach certain levels in this class. When you use this feature, you increase your psi limit by 4 starting at 13th level, by 6 starting at 15th level, and by 8 starting at 17th level.

Beginning at 19th level, you may use this feature twice between long rests. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

\column

## Transcendence
At 20th level, your psionically enhanced understanding of the cosmos allows you to transcend mortal limits. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- You no longer age and cannot be magically aged.
- You are immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition.
- You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any saving throw you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.

## Mystic 
A mystic seeks, above all, to guide those around them through life’s hardships to better understand themselves and their place in the cosmos. By empathically connecting themselves to their allies, the mystic becomes invaluable to their war party, able to coordinate efforts and maintain the party’s wellbeing.

<br>

##### Psychic Counsel
When you choose this mantle at 1st level, you gain the *guidance* cantrip if you don’t already know it. When you cast *guidance*, you may cast it as a psionic spell, requiring no components. If you cast *guidance* this way, it is a clairsentience cantrip.

Additionally, when you reach 3rd level, you may expend 4 psi points while you are concentrating on *guidance* to cast *augury* as an action, requiring no components. When you cast *augury* this way, it is a clairsentience spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.



##### Aura of Awareness
Starting at 3rd level, you project an aura that heightens your allies’ awareness of their surroundings. While you aren’t incapacitated, each ally within 30 feet of you may add their proficiency bonus to initiative checks.

##### Healing Mantra
Beginning at 6th level, you formulate a restorative mantra that, when spoken, amplifies psionic abilities that heal damage. When you manifest a power that restores hit points to a creature, if you add an optional verbal component to the power, that creature regains additional hit points equal to the power’s level.

\column

##### Aura of Celerity
Starting at 14th level, you project an aura that allows your allies to act on their thoughts with improved alacrity. While you aren’t incapacitated, any ally within 30 feet of you can take the Dash action as a bonus action.

## Occultist
An Occultist seeks to part the veils that separate one from hidden knowledge, whether those veils are temporal, physical, or spiritual. An Occultist heightens their sensitivity to emotional and psychic impressions left by others, to glean truths and understanding from the world.

{{classTable,frame,decoration

}}
<br>

##### Occult Knowledge
You have accumulated a mental trove of secrets and hidden knowledge. Starting at 1st level, whenever you roll an Intelligence check to recall any sort of lore (such as that covered by the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skills), treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.

##### Psychic Seance
When you reach 3rd level, you learn the *thaumaturgy* cantrip if you don’t already know it. When you cast *thaumaturgy*, you may cast it as a psionic talent, requiring no components. If you cast *thaumaturgy* this way, it is a metacreativity cantrip and its duration changes to Focus. While you focus on thaumaturgy you may create one of the spell’s effects as an action. You can have three of the spell’s 1-minute effects activate at a time.

Additionally, when you reach 3rd level, you may expend 4 psi points while you are focusing on *thaumaturgy* to cast *speak with dead*, requiring no components. When you cast *speak with dead* this way, it is a clairsentience spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

##### Occult Vision
Beginning at 6th level, your clairvoyant senses enhance your vision and understanding. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet, or the range of your existing darkvision extends by 60 feet. Additionally, you gain the ability to read all writing.

##### Pronounce Omen
Starting at 14th level, you may pronounce a good or ill omen on a creature within 30 feet that you can see and that can hear you. This omen lasts as long as you concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell) for up to 1 minute.

If you pronounce a good omen, the creature gains immunity to one damage type of your choice while you concentrate.

If you pronounce an ill omen, the creature becomes susceptible to one damage type of your choice. While you concentrate, whenever the creature takes damage of the chosen type, it takes extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.

You may use this feature once, and must finish a long rest before you may do so again.

## Wilder
A Wilder is an Empath less defined by a personal philosophy and more by the lack of one. If Wilders could be said to adhere to any philosophy, however, it would be to live freely in the moment and unshackle one’s emotions from outside concerns. A Wilder’s emotions are so strong and uncontrolled that they seep into the world around them in the form of psionic powers. Often taken to be insane or unbalanced due to their great passions, a Wilder’s emotions surge and wane, affecting the potency of their psionic abilities.

Wilders find themselves in violent situations more often than other Empaths, because they don’t hold themselves back and refuse to rein in their more aggressive feelings when their ire is stoked. Whether because they enjoy the exhilarating thrill of it, or because their tempestuous nature drives them to visceral confrontations, Wilders can hold their own in a fight.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Wilder Mantle Powers
| Empath Level | Powers            |
|:------------------|:-----------------:|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st                 | *incite fury, psychic static*               |
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd               | *savage presence*                |
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5th               | *consuming rage*                |
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7th             | *psychosomatic feedback*                |
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9th             | *mass hysteria*                |
}}
<br>

##### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this mantle at 1st level, you gain proficiency in light and medium armor, and one martial melee weapon of your choice.

##### Wild Surge
Starting at 3rd level, you may unshackle your emotions when you manifest a psionic power. Whenever you manifest a telepathy augment, you may either give yourself advantage on a psionic attack roll against one of the power’s targets, or one of the power’s targets suffers disadvantage on its saving throws to resist the power. Additionally, if the power deals psychic damage, you deal 1d12 extra psychic damage to one target of the power.

Using your Wild Surge potentially drains your vitality. Each time you use this feature, roll 1d20. If the result of this roll is equal to or lower than the number of psi points you spent to manifest the power you used in conjunction with this feature, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.

\column
::
##### Psychic Fury
Beginning at 6th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon attacks with psychic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to that target. When you reach 14th level, this extra damage increases to 2d8.


##### Volatile Mind
Starting at 14th level, your surging emotions become difficult for others to affect with magic. Whenever another creature targets you with an enchantment, illusion, or telepathy effect, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your power save DC or it fails to target you successfully, wasting the action it used to attempt to create the effect, but not spending any other resources such as spell slots, psi points, or magic item charges.

In situations where you wish to be targeted by a beneficial effect, you can choose to suspend this ability as a bonus action. It remains inactive for as long as you concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell).

# Fighter

The Fighter is universal to Athas, for all lives under the dark sun must face some kind of battle to survive. Most serve as gladiators, soldiers, merchant guards, or mercenaries. Most gladiators are slaves, but some can make a lucrative living as freemen, training a stable or earning prizes. The city-states rely on slave conscripts for the bulk of their forces, but all maintain a core of elite, trained soldiers such as the Shadow Consorts of Nibenay or Urik’s Obsidian Guard. The merchant houses employ their own armies to protect trade, including well-trained cavalry and foot soldiers. Nobles keep their own bodyguards and small forces, considered a fairly easy job since most nobles are content to avoid conflict. Soldiers of fortune can be found in all settings, and a few have united to form small units operating from fortified bases, such as the Black Reavers outside of Urik.


## Well-Rounded Warriors

Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every Fighter can swing an axe, disarm with a khopesh, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic or psionics. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants in every arena of life.

## Creating a Fighter
As you build your Fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.

You might have enjoyed formal training in a standing army or in a local militia- or you might be self-taught, unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace.

## Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t stack the effects of a Fighting Style option, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Blind Fighting
You have blind sight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness, and force invisible creatures to make a hide check. 

#### Defense
While wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0). You must be wielding a simple or martial weapon or a shield to use this reaction.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

#### Superior Technique 
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Tactician archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.)

You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of attacks made with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack and you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one. In addition, you no longer use your bonus action for your off-hand attack, instead you may use your off-hand attack as part of the attack action once per turn.

#### Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your Fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

## Martial Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Adamant, Beast Rider, Gladiator, Profane Knight, or Tactician, each detailed in the following pages. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Martial Versatility
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial practice:
- Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to Fighters.
- If you know any maneuvers from the Tactician archetype, you can replace one maneuver you know with a different maneuver.


## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

\column

## Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.

## Adamant
Adamants are warriors who have honed their sense of self into a palpable force, fortifying their physical bodies with hardened will. They refine themselves to be faster, stronger, better; realizing their potential through psionically mastered ego.


##### Psionics
When you reach 3rd level, you realize your psionic potential, gaining the use of talents and augments, the rules for which appear in Chapter 11. Psionic powers are magical effects.

***Psionic Talents.*** A psionic talent is a psionic power that is a cantrip spell. You learn two psionic talents: *battle trance* and one of your choice from the Adamant talent list. You learn an additional Adamant talent once you reach 10th level.

***Augments.*** An augment is a psionic power that augments a psionic talent. You must be focusing on an augment’s corresponding psionic talent in order to manifest it. You know two 1st-level powers that augment the Adamant talents you know.

The Augments Known column of the Adamant Psionics table shows when you learn more augments of your choice. When the table indicates that you learn a new augment, you may only choose a power that augments one of the Adamant talents you know. Each of these powers must have a psi cost no greater than your psi limit (see table).

For instance, when you reach 7th level in the Fighter class, you learn one new psionic power that augments an Adamant talent you know, and the power you choose can have a minimum psi cost of up to 4.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose to replace one of your existing powers that augments an Adamant talent you know and replace it with another power that augments any Adamant talent you know. The new power must have a maximum psi cost equal to or less than your psi limit at the time you learn it.

***Psi Points.*** You have an internal reservoir of psionic energy represented by psi points. You must spend psi points from this reserve to manifest a psionic augment.

The number of psi points you have is based on your Fighter level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Adamant Psionics table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. When expending psi points to manifest an augment, you cannot reduce your current psi points to below 0. Your psi point total returns to your maximum when you finish a long rest.

***Psi Limit.*** Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit to the number of psi points you can spend to manifest a psionic augment. The limit is based on your fighter level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Adamant Psionics table. For example, as a 7th-level Fighter, you can spend no more than 4 psi points when manifesting a psionic augment, no matter how many psi points you have.

***Psionic Ability.*** Charisma is your psionic ability for your Adamant powers. You use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Adamant power or when making an attack roll with one.


{{text-align:center

**Power save DC**:: = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

:

##### Strength of Self
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Charisma saving throws. Adamants possess a deep understanding of the mind, and learn to meditate on their ego to reinforce their sense of self.

##### Battlemind
Beginning at 7th level, whenever you use your action to cast a psionic talent, or to produce an effect described in a psionic talent, you may make one weapon attack as a bonus action.


##### Psychic Warrior
At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your psionic abilities. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a psionic power you use on it before the end of your next turn. 


##### Mettle
Beginning at 15th level, you can endure assaults to your vitality and ego. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Constitution or Charisma saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. 


##### Immortal Will
Starting at 18th level, you can draw on your psionic potential to survive life-threatening injury. At the end of your turn while at 0 hit points, you may spend 6 psi points to regain a use of your Second Wind feature (as if you had taken a short rest) and immediately use that feature, requiring no action. If you do, you regain an additional 20 hit points.


{{pageNumber,auto}}

## Beast Rider
Beast Riders excel at mounted combat, typically found among the raiders of the Bandit Wastes or tribal outlanders. Swift and flexible combatants, they are able to lead a charge one moment and circle back to defend their fellows the next. 

##### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Deception, History, Insight, or Performance. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.

##### Born to the Saddle
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated.

Finally, mounting or dismounting costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

##### Unwavering Mark
Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.

While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn’t target you.

In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attacks weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your Fighter level.

Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you re-gain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

##### Warding Maneuver
At 7th level, you learn to fend off incoming strikes. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you’re wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target’s AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack’s damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

\column
:

##### Hold the Line
At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn. 


##### Ferocious Charger
Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you’re mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.


##### Vigilant Defender
Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature’s turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can’t use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

## Gladiator
While any fighter can take a weapon and enter the arena, there are a select few with the resolve to survive all challengers and gain the adoration of the crowds. Such contenders know that, inside the arena or out, the way to dominate your foes is to offer a simple choice- yield, or die fighting. 

##### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.

##### Fighting Spirit
Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself advantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.

You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

##### Disciplined Courtier
Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier. 


\column
::

{{width:7px}} Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).


##### Tireless Spirit
Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use. 

##### Rapid Strike
Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you take the Attack action on your turn and have advantage on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn. 


##### Strength before Death
Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn’t kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes Vitality damage as normal, and reaching 0 Vitality can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Profane Knight
The Profane Knight combines the martial mastery common to all Fighters with the forbidden practice of the arcane. Like Arcanists, Profane Knights use magical techniques to give them an edge in battle, typically focusing their studies on spells of abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant a Profane Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the Fighter’s reach in combat. Compared to Arcanists, Profane Knights know only a handful of spells, committing each to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

##### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See Chapter 9 for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 10 for the Arcanist spell list.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Arcanist spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Arcanist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.


{{text-align:center

**Spell save DC**:: = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
**Spell attack modifier**:: = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
}}

\column

 {{width:7px}} ***Cantrips.*** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Arcanist spell list. You learn an additional Arcanist cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

***Spell Slots.*** The Profane Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *shield* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *shield* using either slot.

***Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.*** You know three 1st-level Arcanist spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the Arcanist spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Profane Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Arcanist spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Arcanist spells you know with another spell of your choice from the Arcanist spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.



##### Weapon Bond
At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

##### War Magic
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page


##### Profane Strike
At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn. 


##### Arcane Charge
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action. 


##### Improved War Magic
Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

## Tactician
Those who study the traditions of a Tactician employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Tactician, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every Fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Tactician archetype, but those who do are well-rounded Fighters of great skill and knowledge.

##### Combat Superiority
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

***Maneuvers.*** You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed in the following pages. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

***Superiority Dice.*** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

***Saving Throws.*** The DC for maneuvers which require your target to make a saving throw is: 

{{text-align:center
**Maneuver save DC**:: = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
}}


:


##### Student of War
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one 

type of artisan’s tools of your choice.


##### Know Your Enemy
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. Choose two of the following to identify: 
- Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score
- Armor Class
- Current hit points
- Total class levels (if any)

##### Improved Combat Superiority
At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

##### Relentless
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

\column





:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

***Ambush.*** When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't incapacitated.

***Bait and Switch.*** When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn't incapacitated. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

***Distracting Strike.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening.

\column

 {{width:7px}} ***Maneuvering Attack.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position.

That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

***Menacing Attack.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

***Parry.*** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

***Precision Attack.*** When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

***Pushing Attack.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.

***Quick Toss.*** As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged attack with a weapon that has the thrown property. You can draw the weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.

# Icon

Icons are champions of their own true inner selves, called the “ego.” They channel the collective unconscious, a psychic network that fundamentally links all sentient minds below the level of conscious thought, and draw from it metaphorical masks of disposition and attitude, called “personas.” To be an Icon means adapting your ego to handle whatever comes your way by donning these personas and imbuing them with psionic power.


## Awakening of the self
All Icons go through an awakening in which they open their mind and soul to the collective unconscious. Through this connection, you become able to consciously draw on the personas most people adopt subconsciously, and infuse them with psionic potential to manifest magical effects.

Additionally, with further understanding of your own psyche and its place in the collective unconscious, you may become able to identify and empower the iconic archetype that lies at the center of your ego.

## Face any challenge
Icons use the versatility and adaptability of their personas to fit themselves into whatever role they or their allies might need. Is the party delving into a dark, ancient jungle? Then adopting The Chariot persona to project yourself as a fearless explorer would provide you the skills you need to survive. The silver tongue granted by your persona of Fortitude, however, might serve you better in negotiations with your party’s patron. The strength of an Icon lies in the vast repertoire of personas they have to draw on.

## Creating an Icon
When creating an Icon, consider what it was that triggered your awakening. Was it a concerted effort of strict discipline and rigorous meditation, or a sudden epiphany that bestowed awareness of the collective unconscious unto you? When you parted the mists of your mind to reveal the true nature of your ego, were you able to accept what you saw? Do you adopt personas to accentuate your ego, or to hide it? 

Though you retain your sense of identity, the outward expression of your ego that you present to the world changes from situation to situation. Are these changes subtle and nearly indistinguishable from the mundane moods and attitudes others might find themselves adopting, or are they noticeable and disconcerting to those who witness the shift?

\column

<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Iconic Archetypes
While Icons freely swap between personas, metaphorically wearing different masks for different situations, their true face or core personality remains the same. This true inner self, once discoverd, is referred to as their iconic archetype. 

* **The Heart.** Those embodying the Heart are the best of allies, supporting their war parties in a myriad of ways. 

<br>

* **The Noble.** Those embodying the Noble have the certainty of self to lead the charge, inspiring others to follow. 

<br>

* **The Warrior.** Those embodying the Warrior live for the purity of battle, finding their true self when staring down death. 

 </div>

## Cognitive Personas
As an Icon, you gain the ability to don psychological “masks” called cognitive personas. These personas are iconic reflections of attitudes and dispositions drawn from the collective unconscious and bound together to present a barrier between one’s true inner self and the obstacles and dangers encountered in the world.

Donning a persona is an entirely mental change; your physical form and appearance do not typically change when you don a persona, unless otherwise specified.

#### Personas Held
Whenever you finish a long rest, you may cast your mind into the collective unconscious and select a number of personas to hold within you, choosing from the “Cognitive Personas” section at the end of the class’s description.

Initially, you can hold only two personas at once, though your capacity grows when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Personas Held column of the Icon table.

#### Active Persona and Swapping
You can only have one active persona at a time. You change your active persona by switching which “mask” you currently “wear.” When you select the personas you hold within you after a long rest, you must choose one to become your active persona. Your chosen persona remains your active persona even if you sleep, are knocked unconscious, or are otherwise incapacitated.

As an action, you may swap your active persona for another persona you currently have held; the chosen persona becomes your new active persona until you swap it again or finish a long rest.

Starting at 5th level, you may swap your active persona as a bonus action instead of an action, and when you reach 14th level, swapping no longer requires an action of any kind—but you may still only do so while you are conscious and only once during your turn.


#### Persona Benefits
Each persona has a constant benefit associated with it. You only gain a persona’s benefit if that persona is your active persona. If you wish to gain a different persona’s benefit, you must swap your active persona.


#### Cognitive Projection
As an Icon, you have the ability to psychically project a magical effect from your active persona called a Cognitive Projection. When you use your Cognitive Projection, it takes on the effect of the 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

Cognitive Projection ability of your active persona. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Cognitive Projection again. 

Some Cognitive Projection abilities require saving throws. When you use such an ability from a persona, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Cognitive Projection twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all of your expended uses.

## Psionics

Starting at 2nd level, you realize your psionic potential, gaining the use of talents and augments, the rules for which appear in Chapter 11. Psionic powers are magical effects.

#### Psionic Talents

A psionic talent is a psionic power that is a cantrip spell. You know two psionic talents of your choice from the Icon talent list. You learn additional Icon talents of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Talents Known column of the Icon table.


#### Augments

An augment is a psionic power that augments a psionic talent. You must be focusing on an augment’s appropriate psionic talent in order to manifest it. When you reach 2nd level, you know three 1st-level powers that augment the icon talents you know.

The Augments Known column of the Icon table shows when you learn more augments of your choice. When the table indicates you learn a new augment, you may only choose a power that augments one of the Icon talents you know. Each of these powers must have a psi cost no greater than your psi limit (see table).

For instance, when you reach 6th level in this class, you learn one new psionic power that augments an Icon talent you know, and the power you choose can have a minimum psi cost of up to 4.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose to replace one of your existing powers that augments an Icon talent you know and replace it with another power that augments any icon talent you know. The new power must have a minimum psi cost of no higher than your psi limit at the time you learn it.


#### Psi Points
You have an internal reservoir of psionic energy represented by psi points. You must spend psi points from this reserve to manifest a power that augments a psionic talent.

The number of psi points you have is based on your Icon level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Icon table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. When expending psi points to manifest an augment, you cannot reduce your current psi points to below 0. Your psi point total returns to your maximum when you finish a long rest.

#### Psi Limit
Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit to the number of psi points you can spend to manifest a power that augments a psionic talent. The limit is based on your Icon level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Icon table. For example, as a 5th-level Icon, you can spend no more than 4 psi points when manifesting an augment, no matter how many psi points you have.


#### Icon Talents
Below is a list of psionic talents available to Icons. The descriptions of these powers can be found in Chapter 12.

*aura beacon*

*autonomous vitality*

*battle trance*

*energy ray*

*inertial transference*

*mind thrust*

*mindlink*

*mystic displacement*

*speed of thought*

*true shot*

*wild technique*


## Psychic Potency
When you reach 2nd level, the raw psychic strength of your attacks and powers increases. When a creature takes damage from one of your powers or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d4 psychic damage to that creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), but only once per turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

As you gain levels, the psychic strength of your attacks and powers becomes even more potent. The die you roll for this feature increases to a d6 at 6th level, a d8 at 10th level, a d10 at 14th level, and a d12 at 18th level.


## Iconic Archetype

At 3rd level, choose one of the iconic archetypes on the following pages: the Heart, the Noble, or the Warrior. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 3rd level. It also grants you additional features at 5th, 11th, and 15th level.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
## Id Barrier

Starting at 7th level, you may reflexively draw on your id, your core survival instinct, in order to avoid harm, manifesting a brief, invisible psychic barrier to protect you.

As a reaction to being attacked or making a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to your Armor Class against the triggering attack or on the triggering saving throw equal to the number of personas you currently have held.

You can wait until after the d20 roll of the attack or saving throw to use this reaction, but you must decide before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses, or whether the saving throw succeeds or fails.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\column

## The World

At 20th level, you gain access to The World, the final persona, representing accomplishment, integration, and completeness. The World is a special persona that increases your ability to use other personas. It does not count against your number of held personas, and does not need to be active, instead always granting you the following permanent benefits:

* Once per turn, requiring no action, if you are conscious you can replace one of your held personas with another persona you are not currently holding.
* All held personas are active personas.
* You gain the benefits of all active personas simultaneously.
* Whenever you use your Cognitive Projection, you can choose one effect from the Cognitive Projection abilities of your held personas.

## The Heart

An Icon who recognizes their true self as The Heart takes joy in supporting others. Whether offering a shoulder to cry on, an encouraging word, or tough love, these Icons are nurturers through-and-through.


##### Bonus Proficiencies

When you discover this iconic archetype within you at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Insight and Persuasion skills.

##### Improved Psychic Potency

Starting at 5th level, your inner nature allows you to cultivate greater potency out of your psychic abilities. Whenever you use your Psychic Potency feature, you roll twice the number of dice indicated for your level.

When you reach 11th level, you instead roll three times the number of dice indicated for your level.


##### Nurtured Potency

Also beginning at 5th level, your inner nature allows you to channel your psychic potency toward the wellbeing of your allies.

When you manifest a psionic power that would allow you to restore the hit points of a creature other than yourself, you can use your Psychic Potency feature, if available, to increase the number of hit points the power restores. Instead of rolling Psychic Potency’s dice to deal psychic damage, you roll the feature’s dice and increase the number of hit points you restore to one creature by the result of your roll.
 
Extra dice from your Improved Psychic Potency feature applies to this use of Psionic Potency.


##### Empathic Anchor

Beginning at 11th level, your allies can count on you to be their keystone, their rock, their sanctuary. If an ally you can see within 60 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can expend a use of your Id Barrier feature as a reaction to bestow its benefit to that ally’s saving throw.

Additionally, whenever you finish a short rest, you regain all expended uses of your Id Barrier feature.

\column
::

##### Empathic Sentinel

Starting at 15th level, immediately after you or an ally you can see within 60 feet takes damage, you may produce an effect described in a psionic talent you are focusing on, or manifest a power that augments it, requiring no action. The effect or augment must normally require an action to produce or manifest, and you must spend psi points as normal, if applicable.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/y04pr5M/the-heart.png' style='position:relative; top:110px; left:-455px; height:900px; width:500px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

\page

## The Noble

An Icon identifying with the Noble is steadfast, inspiring, and righteous. While some may be accused of being heedless of danger, these Icons are willing to sacrifice themselves to achieve greater results and protect others.

##### Heroic Defense

Beginning at 3rd level, your sheer presence and fortitude protects you from attacks. While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier (max 2) + your Charisma modifier.

##### Extra Attack

Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

##### Inspiring Will

Beginning at 11th level, you can no longer be charmed or frightened. Additionally, if an ally you can see within 60 feet of you becomes charmed or frightened, you can use your reaction to remove either or both conditions from that ally, provided they can hear and understand you.

##### Valiant Reprise

Also starting at 11th level, once per turn when you miss with a melee weapon attack, you can immediately make another attack against the same target with advantage.

##### Victory or Death

When you reach 15th level, you gain the ability to make a sacrifice of yourself, psionically consuming your physical form to ensure your success. If you do, you gain a second action on your turn, and all of your attacks, checks, and saves are made with advantage until the start of your next turn.

At the end of your turn, your current and maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to twice your level. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest, and cannot be mitigated in any way. If this reduces your maximum hit points to 0, you die.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## The Warrior

Warrior Icons are aggressive thrill seekers. They desire to test their mettle and strength against greater and greater challenges. Warriors care not for long term consequences, living squarely in the here and now.

##### Bonus Proficiencies

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium and heavy armor.

##### Extra Attack

Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class.

##### Mettle

Beginning at 11th level, you can endure assaults to your vitality and ego. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Constitution or Charisma saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

##### Lion’s Charge

Beginning at 15th level, whenever you take the Dash action on your turn, your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity until the end of your turn, and you can make two melee weapon attacks as a bonus action during that turn.


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/93RYGqt/the-warrior.jpg' style='position:relative; top:-40px; left:-130px; height:1000px; width:610px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Cognitive Personas

Each persona gives a short description of the kind of disposition or attitude most usually associated with that persona, and then details that persona’s benefit and Cognitive Projection ability.

If a persona has prerequisites, you must meet them in order to select that persona as one of your held personas.

##### The Fool
Not to be mistaken for a lack of intellect, the Fool represents the possibility of learning. The Fool can be seen as the persona with the most potential to adapt, as it has nothing to do but grow.

***Benefit.*** Once per round, when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check that doesn’t include your proficiency bonus, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the result of your check. When you reach certain levels in the Icon class, you can roll a larger die instead; a d6 starting at 9th level, and a d8 starting at 17th.

***Cognitive Projection: Tabula Rasa.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to force a completely blank slate on one creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails, it cannot speak and the only actions it can take are the Attack, Dodge, and Disengage actions. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on itself on a success.


##### The Magician
Representing self-confidence, innate talent, and mental prowess, the Magician enables you to make your desires manifest.

***Benefit.*** The first time you select the Magician as your active persona after a long rest, choose one skill that you have proficiency in. Until you finish your next long rest, whenever the Magician is your active persona you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with the chosen skill.

***Cognitive Projection: Empowered Psionics.*** When you use your Psychic Potency feature, you can use your Cognitive Projection to reroll the feature’s die. If you have the Improved Psychic Potency feature, you may reroll any number of Psychic Potency dice. You must use the new result.




##### The Priestess
The Priestess is the guardian of secret knowledge and the subconscious. This persona reveals mysteries and heightens awareness.

***Benefit.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall any sort of lore, you can treat a d20 roll of a 7 or lower as an 8.

***Cognitive Projection: Psychic Revelation.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to target a point you can see within 60 feet. Each invisible creature within a 10 foot radius sphere of that point must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or emanate a pale blue light from their head (or equivalent anatomy).

The affected creature can’t benefit from being invisible, and any attack roll against an affected creature has advantage on the attack if the attacker can see the blue light. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success.


##### The Empress
Embodying the traits of elegance and grace, the Empress enhances one’s poise and calmness.

***Benefit.*** Whenever you make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, a Charisma (Performance) check, or an ability check you make with a musical instrument, you can treat a d20 roll of a 7 or lower as an 8.

***Cognitive Projection: Saving Grace.*** Whenever you miss with an attack or fail an ability check, you can use your Cognitive Projection as a reaction to gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to the next attack roll or ability check you make before the end of your next turn.


##### The Emperor
Representing respect, discipline, and stability, the Emperor reflects an air of authority.

***Benefit.*** Whenever you make a Strength (Athletics) check, Charisma (Intimidation) check, or a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, you can treat a d20 roll of a 7 or lower as an 8.

***Cognitive Projection: Demand Obedience.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to issue a short command, no more than two words, to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or follow the command on its next turn. This ability has no effect if the target doesn’t understand you, or if the command is directly harmful to it.


##### The Hierophant
Possessed of a respect for traditions and mentorship, the Hierophant values trust in others.

***Benefit.*** You can take the Help action as a bonus action.

***Cognitive Projection: Entrust Destiny.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as a reaction to grant an ally you can see within 60 feet of you a second reaction before the start of their next turn. You can use this reaction before a triggering event, allowing your ally to trigger their own reaction in response to the same event, if applicable.


##### The Lovers
The Lovers persona represents not one side of a relationship, the personal feeling of love, but rather the duality of both sides and the nature of the relationship itself. The Lovers is the persona one adopts when communication and harmony are of the utmost importance.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

 {{width:7px}} ***Benefit.*** You can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for either of you to understand the other, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to your communication, but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation with you.

***Cognitive Projection: Sense Dishonesty.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as a reaction to attempt to discern if a statement you just understood is a lie. The creature that issued the statement must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you know for a certainty whether the statement is true to the best of the creature’s knowledge, or if the creature deliberately lied. If the statement falls into neither of those categories, or if the creature succeeds on their saving throw, you discern no information about the statement.


##### The Chariot
The Chariot represents the will to advance, to move forward, to overcome obstacles. Determination and physical strength are important facets of the Chariot persona.

***Benefit.*** You ignore difficult terrain and have advantage on initiative rolls.

***Cognitive Projection: Channeled Might.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to make yourself count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity, the weight you can push, drag, or lift, and for the purposes of grappling other creatures and being grappled. This effect lasts for up to 1 hour.

Additionally, for the duration of this effect, whenever you would make an ability check to start, maintain, or escape from a grapple, you may make a Charisma (Athletics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check, as you psionically enhance your physical prowess with your empowered ego.


##### Fortitude
Representing inner strength and understanding, the Fortitude persona embodies compassion and influence.

***Benefit.*** Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check or a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can treat a d20 roll of a 7 or lower as an 8.

***Cognitive Projection: Determination.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to urge determination in another creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature has advantage on attack rolls and ability checks for as long as you concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute.

\column

##### The Hermit
Withdrawn, the Hermit seeks isolation from outside distractions in order to pursue self-reflection and find inner wisdom.

***Benefit.*** You have advantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration.

***Cognitive Projection: Quantum of Solace.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to compel a creature to isolate itself from others. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target cannot make attacks, affect other creatures with magical effects (such as spells or psionic powers), or deliberately touch another creature for as long as you concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute.

This effect ends early if another creature affects the target with a magical effect, or otherwise attacks, damages, or touches the target. The target resists even harmless attempts to be touched, and a creature attempting to harmlessly touch the target must succeed on a melee weapon attack using an unarmed strike against the target, dealing no damage on a hit.


##### The Wheel

Representing the cyclical nature of good and bad fortune, the Wheel embodies chaos and luck.

***Benefit.*** The first time you select the Wheel as your active persona after a long rest, roll a d6. Until you finish your next long rest, whenever the Wheel is your active persona, you have resistance to one of the following types of damage depending on the result of your d6 roll.

 {{width:7px}} ***Cognitive Projection: Wild Card.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and compel them to chaos. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or roll a d4 to determine what it does during its next turn. On a 1 or 2, the creature takes no action but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 3 or 4, the creature makes one melee or ranged attack against a random creature it can see other than you, or does nothing if no creature is within reach or range.



{{pageNumber,auto}}

##### Justice
Opposite the Wheel, the Justice persona represents just action and earned results, embodying the implacable nature of law and truth.

***Benefit.*** You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class, gain resistance to poison damage, and cannot be poisoned.

***Cognitive Projection: Even Hand.*** Whenever you would roll an attack roll, you can use your Cognitive Projection as a reaction to forgo rolling a d20, and determine the result of your attack as if you had rolled a 10 on the d20 instead. You must choose whether to use this ability before actually rolling the d20.


##### The Hanged Man
At its best, the Hanged Man represents putting aside old perspectives and looking at things anew, discovering new ways to move forward that were not apparent before. At its worst, the Hanged Man embodies indecision and distraction from one’s goals.

***Benefit.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check or a Wisdom (Perception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of a 7 or lower as an 8.

***Cognitive Projection: Crippling Indecision.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to compel intense feelings of self-doubt in a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature makes attack rolls and ability checks with disadvantage for as long as you concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute.


##### Death
*Prerequisite: 9th level*

While the Death persona can indeed embody literal death, it more accurately encompasses all endings. Further, it also encourages overcoming these endings, and moving forward towards something new.

***Benefit.*** You are immune to mundane and magical disease and cannot be cursed (though any existing curses remain in effect). Additionally, your hit point maximum cannot be reduced by another creature. If your hit point maximum is already reduced when Death becomes your active persona, it remains reduced.

***Cognitive Projection: Memento Mori.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to target a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see and induce an intense belief within it that it is dying. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked unconscious and begins making stabilizing saving throws as though it were unconscious at 0 hit points (though its hit point total remains the same).

Once the target succeeds on one stabilization saving throw, fails three stabilization saving throws, or takes any amount of damage, this effect ends and it returns to consciousness, though it still believes it was on the verge of true death.


##### Temperance
*Prerequisite: 9th level*

Temperance reflects self-moderation of one’s actions and emotions, fostering inner balance and promoting patience.

***Benefit.*** Whenever you are subjected to a magical effect that allows you to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your reaction to partially mitigate the effect, taking no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, or only half damage if you fail. You must decide to take this reaction before you roll your saving throw.

***Cognitive Projection: Calming Touch.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to suppress hostility in a creature you touch. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become indifferent toward every creature it was previously hostile toward. This indifference ends after 1 minute, or if the target is attacked, harmed by a magical effect, or witnesses any of its allies being harmed. When the indifference ends, it becomes hostile again.


##### The Devil
*Prerequisite: 9th level*

Representing one’s darker self, the Devil embodies temptation, hedonism, and—at its worst—addiction.

***Benefit.*** You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Magical darkness does not impede this darkvision.

***Cognitive Projection: Tempting Whispers.*** Whenever you would force a creature to make a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw, you can use your Cognitive Projection to roll a d6 and subtract the number you rolled from the creature’s saving throw result. You can choose to use this ability after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the saving throw succeeds or fails. The creature is immune to this effect if they are immune to being charmed.


##### The Tower
*Prerequisite: 13th level*

The Tower is a force of destruction and upheaval. It signifies sudden disaster and ruin.

***Benefit.*** Whenever you score a critical hit, one die of your damage roll is treated as if it rolled its highest result. You can choose which die benefits from this effect after you have rolled all of your damage dice.

***Cognitive Projection: Harbinger of Doom.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to curse one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or the next time that creature takes 





{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

damage within the next minute it is vulnerable to that damage.

##### The Star
*Prerequisite: 13th level*

The Star encompasses renewal and healing, both spiritual and physical, proving hope in the face of disaster and setbacks.

***Benefit.*** At the start of your turn, if your hit point total is less than half of your maximum hit points, you regain a number of hit points equal to your Charisma modifier.

***Cognitive Projection: Hope Springs Eternal.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to bestow renewing psychic energy on another creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is alive but currently has 0 hit points. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to half of its maximum hit points.

##### The Moons
*Prerequisite: 13th level*

Embodying uncertainty and illusions, the Moons bend the truth and deceive the senses.

***Benefit.*** As an action, you can magically make yourself— including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until you use your action to change your appearance again, or swap to a different active persona. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the change is up to you.

The changes wrought by this ability fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this ability to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this ability to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

***Cognitive Projection: Lunar Cloak.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to cause you or a creature you touch to become invisible for as long as you concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Anything the affected creature is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on that creature’s person.

\column

##### The Sun
*Prerequisite: 17th level*

Representing success and prosperity, the Sun radiates happiness and joy with its disposition and bearing. The Sun is nearly unassailable, impervious to attempts to bring it down.

***Benefit.*** You are immune to force, psychic, and radiant damage, and cannot be possessed.

***Cognitive Projection: Dawnwalker.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to begin shining like the sun for as long as you concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. While you are shining, you shed bright light out to a radius of 30 feet, and dim light for an additional 30 feet beyond that. This light is sunlight.

Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 5 feet of you or enters a space within 5 feet of you while you are shining, you may choose to have that creature make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of their turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not blinded.


##### The Aeon
*Prerequisite: 17th level*

The Aeon represents time, reincarnation, and salvation. While Justice represents the judgement of objective truth and law, the Aeon embodies one’s personal judgement, often leading to a personal rebirth, and the beginning of a new era.

***Benefit.*** Whenever you would make a stabilization saving throw while unconscious, you can make a Charisma saving throw instead. If the total result of your saving throw is 20 or higher, you immediately heal 10 hit points and stand up from prone.

***Cognitive Projection: End of an Era.*** You can use your Cognitive Projection as an action to instantly end the duration of one magical effect on a creature or object within 30 feet of you.

# Monk

Monks are students of the psionic practice called the Way, united in their ability to hone and harness the psionic energy that flows in their bodies. Practicing techniques of meditation to perform feats of focus far beyond any mere wild talent, Monks represent the pinnacle of physical psionics. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, the Way infuses all that a Monk does.


## The Energy of Psionics
Monks make careful study of a psionic energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is one aspect of the psionics found across Athas—specifically, the aspect that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create psionic effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using psionics, Monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

## Teachings of the Arena
There are no monasteries on Athas. Rather, a style of fighting emerged from the gladiator pits in response to a demand for unarmed combat, and from those combatants, underground monastic orders formed, united by a practice they call the Way. Due to their popular crowd appeal, enough have been granted freedom that they have spread out and trained others, or sought greater enlightenment in the harsh unknowns of the desert. A master Monk is rare as steel, and just as dangerous.

For a Monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving the structure and respect of the arena behind to become a wanderer, often with little to show for a lifetime of spilling blood. This can be a harsh transition, and Monks don’t undertake it lightly. 

## Creating a Monk 
As you make your Monk character, think about where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you taken off the streets, another mud rat forced into arena service?  Did you come seeking the tutelage of a famous gladiator? Were you hiding from something? Someone?  

Consider why you left. Did you earn your freedom in the ring? Were you cast out after a blood match went too far? Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you now seek? 

\column

## Martial Arts
At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and Monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:
- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and Monk weapons.
- You can roll a d4 Martial Arts Die in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or Monk weapon. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. If your race has natural weapons, use their damage until the Martial Arts die surpasses them.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a Monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. 

Certain Monks use specialized forms of the Monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a Monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in Chapter 5.

## Ki
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features, and gain more at later levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, during which you must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points once finished.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
{{text-align:center
**Ki save DC**:: = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
}}

#### Flurry of Blows 
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

#### Patient Defense
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

#### Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page


## Dedicated Weapon
At 2nd level, you can choose one weapon to be a Monk weapon each short or long rest, lasting until another is chosen.  This weapon must be a simple or martial weapon that you are proficient with, and cannot have the heavy or special properties. 

## Unarmored Movement
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet if you don't have a shield or armor equipped.  This bonus increases as shown in the Monk Table.  

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn.

## Monastic Order
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic order: that of the Astral Self, the Long Death, the Merciful End, the Open Hand, or the Soulknife, each shown on the following pages. Your order grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

## Deflect Missiles
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. Afterwards, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the missile as part of the same reaction. The attack is made with proficiency, and the missile acts as a Monk weapon for this attack.

## Ki-Fueled Attack
At 3rd level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or two ability scores  by 1. You cannot increase an ability score above 20. 

## Quickened Healing
Starting at 4th level, you can use an action and spend 2 ki points to roll a Martial Arts die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your proficiency bonus.

## Slow Fall
Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your Monk level.

## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Focused Aim
Beginning at 5th level, when you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning a miss to a hit.

## Stunning Strike
Starting at 5th level, when you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

## Ki-Empowered Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

## Evasion
At 7th level, when an effect causes you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage, you take no damage on  success and only half if you fail. 

## Stillness of Mind
Starting at 7th level, you can use an action to end one effect causing you to be charmed or frightened.

## Purity of Body
At 10th level, your mastery of the ki makes you immune to disease and poison.

## Tongue of the Dark Sun
Starting at 13th level, your psionics allow you to speak and be understood in any spoken language. 

## Diamond Soul
At 14th level, you gain proficiency in all saving throws and can spend 1 ki point to reroll a failed saving throw. You must use the second result. 

## Timeless Body
At 15th level, you become immune to the effects of aging, and no longer require food or water. 

## Empty Body
Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible and gain resistance to all damage except force for 1 minute. 

## Perfect Self
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative with no ki remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Order of the Astral Self
A Monk who follows the Order of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or disorder, with some Monks training students to use their power to protect the weak and others instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to the mighty.

{{note
##### Forms of Your Astral Self
The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the Monk's soul. As a result, an astral self can reflect aspects of a Monk's background, ideals, flaws, and bonds, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look anything like the Monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky Human might be reminiscent of a Minotaur, the strength of which the Monk feels within. Similarly, a Tarek Monk might manifest gossamer arms and a delicate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the Tarek's soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the Monks of this monastic tradition are known more for the appearance of their astral self than for their physical appearance.

<br>

When choosing this path, consider the quirks that define your Monk. Are you obsessed with something? Are you driven by justice or a selfish desire? Any of these motivations could manifest in the form of your astral self.
}}

##### Arms of the Astral Self
At 3rd level, your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die. For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance, and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.

While the spectral arms are present, you gain the following benefits:
- You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes.
- When you make an unarmed strike with the arms on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
- The unarmed strikes you make with the arms can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and their damage type is force.

\column
::
##### Visage of the Astral Self
At 6th level, you can summon the visage of your astral self. As a bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you take to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 1 ki point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die.

The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral visage is present, you gain the following benefits.

***Astral Sight.*** You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

***Wisdom of the· Spirit.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

***Word of the Spirit.*** When you speak, you can direct your words to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you, making it so only that creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can amplify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet can hear you.

##### Body of the Astral Self
Starting at 11th level, when you have both your astral arms and visage summoned, you can cause the body of your astral self to appear (no action required). This spectral body covers your physical form like a suit of armor, connecting with the arms and visage. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral body is present, you gain the following benefits.

***Deflect Energy.*** When you take acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to deflect it. When you do so, the damage you take is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum reduction of 1).

***Empowered Arms.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the Arms of the Astral Self, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.

##### Awakened Astral Self
Upon reaching 17th level, your connection to your astral self is complete, allowing you to unleash its full potential. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 ki points to summon the arms, visage, and body of your astral self and awaken it for 10 minutes. This awakening ends early if you are incapacitated or die. While your astral self is awakened, you gain the following benefits. 

***Armor of the Spirit.*** You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class.

***Astral Barrage.*** Whenever you use the Extra Attack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack  three times if all the attacks are made with your astral arms.

## Order of the Long Death
Monks of the Order of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of defilement. They are known to hunt Arcanists until their prey is desperate enough to draw upon the darkest temptations of magic, then study every disastrous second until they are capable of using psionics to mimic the effects. They then use this knowledge to guide their understanding of martial arts, sapping the life of their enemies with each blow and absorbing that essence for their own benefit. 

##### Touch of Death
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your study of defilement allows you to extract vitality from another creature as it nears its demise. When you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Monk level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). 

\column

##### Hour of Reaping
At 6th level, you gain the ability to unsettle or terrify those around you as an action, for your soul has been marked by the taint of defilement. When you take this action, each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. 

##### Mastery of Death
Beginning at 11th level, you use your familiarity with death to escape its grasp. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 ki point (no action required) to have 1 hit point instead. 

##### Salt the Earth
Starting at 17th level, your touch can channel the energy of death into a creature. As an action, you touch one creature within 5 feet of you, and you expend 1d10 ki points. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, and it takes 2d10 necrotic damage per ki point spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Order of the Merciful End
Monks of the Order of the Merciful End learn to manipulate the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt. However, to those beyond their help, they bring a swift end as an act of mercy. 

Monks of this Order might be members of a Sorcerer-King's religious coterie, administering to the wealthy and making the grim choices others would not dare voice to those in power. Others might follow a more idealistic path, tending to the needy without shying from the realistic limits of the aid they can bring to the oppressed. Still others might prowl the beds of a hospice or quarantined plague, delivering swift and merciful deaths to those they see as too far gone. 

The members of this Order usually don robes with deep cowls, and they often conceal their faces with masks, presenting themselves as the faceless harbingers of life and death.

##### Implements of Mercy
When joining this Order, you gain proficiency in the Insight and Medicine skills, and you gain proficiency with the herbalism kit.

##### Hand of Healing
After joining this Order, your mystical touch can mend wounds. As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to touch a creature  and restore a number of hit points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with a use of this feature without spending a ki point for the healing.

##### Hand of Harm
After joining this Order, you use your ki to inflict wounds. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to deal extra necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature only once per turn.

##### Physician's Touch
At 6th level, you can administer even greater cures with a touch, and if you feel it's necessary, you can use your knowledge to cause harm.

When you use Hand of Healing on a creature, you can also end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the creature: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.

When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can subject that creature to the poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.


\column


##### Flurry of Healing and Harm
At 11th level, you can now mete out a flurry of comfort and hurt. When you use Flurry of Blows, you can now replace each of the unarmed strikes with a use of your Hand of Healing, without spending ki points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an unarmed strike with Flurry of Blows, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without spending the ki point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.



##### Hand of Ultimate Mercy
Upon reaching 17th level, your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 ki points. The creature then returns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it revives with them removed: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/y4tL21C/merciful-end.jpg' style='position:relative; top: 360px; left:-400px; height:620px; width:400px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Order of the Open Hand
Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.


##### Open Hand Technique
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
- It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.

##### Wholeness of Body
At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your Monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

\column
::
##### Tranquility
Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a *sanctuary* spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

##### Quivering Palm
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

## Order of the Soulknife
Monks within the Order of the Soulknife focus their Will to pierce through the barriers of mind, soul, and body, allowing them to use their ki power to manifest blades of pure psionic energy.

##### Soulknife Talent
Starting at 3rd level, you know the *mindblade* psionic talent. Wisdom is your psionic ability for this power. When you cast this, the mindblade you create with it counts as a monk weapon for you.

##### Disciple of the Mindblade
Also at 3rd level, you learn all psionic powers that augment *mindblade*. Wisdom is your psionic ability for these powers.

In order to manifest an augment you learned with this feature, you must expend a number of ki points equal to the augment’s power level + 1 (including level increases for an intensified power), instead of the power’s normal psi cost. 

For example, to manifest *psychic strike* at its minimum strength as a 1st-level power, you must spend 2 ki points. To manifest it as though you spent 4 psi points on it to intensify it to a 2nd-level power, you must spend 3 ki points.

The maximum amount of ki points you can expend on any one manifestation of a psionic augment is shown in the table below. Some augments may be out of your reach to manifest until you reach higher levels in the Monk class. 



{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Augmenting and Ki Points
| Monk Level    | Max Ki Points for a Power |
|:-------------:|:-----:|
| 3rd -- 4th    | 2     |
| 5th -- 8th    | 3     |
| 9th -- 12th   | 4     |
| 13th -- 16th  | 5     |
| 17th -- 20th  | 6     |
}}

##### Master the Blade
Starting at 6th level, you gain  mastery over the mindblade. You gain the following benefits:

***Manifest Soul.*** Choose a type of damage: radiant or necrotic. Whenever you cast *mindblade*, you may choose for your mindblades to deal the damage type you choose for this feature, instead of the damage types normally available. 

Additionally, whenever you manifest the *psychic strike* power, you may choose  to deal the same type of damage as the one you choose for this ability.

***Twin Blades.*** You may create two mindblades when you cast *mindblade* instead of one. If you do, one appears around each of your fists, and you may make one attack with a mindblade as a bonus action after you use the Attack action to attack with the other mindblade. While you have two 


\column


mindblades created, neither one can be forced from your hands, preventing you from using your hands for any other purpose while you focus on the *mindblade* talent.


##### Rift Technique
At 11th level, you learn how to sever the barriers between time and space, granting you several psychoportation abilities:

***Rift Throw.*** Mindblades you create with the *mindblade* talent have the thrown property, with a range of 60/120. While you focus on *mindblade*, you may let go of a mindblade but only to make ranged weapon attacks with it. Immediately following each ranged attack with a mindblade, the mindblade teleports, returning to your grip.

***Rift Leap.*** You may spend 2 ki points as a bonus action to teleport up to 100 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

***Rift Strike.*** Whenever you hit a creature with a melee attack using a mindblade, you may spend 2 ki points to force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is teleported up to 100 feet away from its previous position, in any direction you choose, to an unoccupied space you can see that includes a solid surface that can support the creature’s weight.

##### Knife to the Soul
Beginning at 17th level, whenever you hit a creature with a melee attack using a mindblade, you may spend 8 ki to forgo making a damage roll for the attack and instead immediately cast *feeblemind* on the target, requiring no components and ignoring the spell’s normal casting time. You can use this feature once, and you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

# Nomad

Far from the bustle of city-states and their client towns, past the walls and the defiled scars that encircle the Sorcerer-Kings’ territory, amid the vast, treacherous wastes with their buried ruins and their strange, ferocious beasts, Nomads wander. Surviving off land others deem cursed and forsaken, taming creatures others see only as monsters, keeping knowledge of the old ways and the forgotten threats they were meant to contain- this is the lot of the Nomad. 

## Deadly Hunters
A Nomad’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wastes and hiding themselves in sand and rubble. In some places, Nomads gather in secretive orders or join forces with Druidic circles. Most Nomads, however, are independent almost to fault, knowing they may be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense when a pack of dagorran or a band of Elvhen attacks.

## Independent Adventurers
Nomads are found in every race, though most prominently among Elvhen and Seedlings. Despite this, there are few places where Nomads gather in numbers- their calling to defend the wasteland keeps them on the move, stopping only to find worthy apprentices.

This fierce independence makes Nomads well suited to adventuring. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wastes, Nomads respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and pity. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. 

## Creating a Nomad
As you create your Nomad character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wastes together until you mastered the nomadic ways? Or perhaps you were part of a band of Nomads affiliated with a Druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as nomadic lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessities of survival in the wastes.

What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wastes, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?


<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Nomadic Traditions
Every Nomad shares an understanding of the wastes, but those who survive long enough tend towards specialization in certain disciplines. 

* **Beast Master.** These Nomads have earned the respect of Athas' beasts, fighting beside rather than against their companions.  

<br>

* **Gloom Stalker.** In the freezing chill of Athas nights, dark horrors abound- these Nomads stand vigil against the monsters others do not even know to fear. 

<br>

* **Hunter.** These Nomads dedicate themselves to the thin line between civilization and wasteland, thinning the foes that would threaten their homes. 

<br>

* **Monster Slayer.** Some foes cannot be fought back, and these Nomads train to track and exterminate the worst of Athas' terrors. 

<br>

* **Psionic Wanderer.** These Nomads have learned to add psionic tricks to their arsenal, guarding against the strange creatures that prey on mind and soul. 

 </div>

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (*a*) scale mail or (*b*) leather armor
- (*a*) two shortswords or (*b*) two simple melee weapons
- (*a*) a dune trader’s pack or *b*) an explorer’s pack
- A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows


## Favored Foe
When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you can increase that damage by 1d4.

You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.

\column


## Deft Explorer
You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wastelands and in dealing with others on your travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit below when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.

#### Canny (1st Level)
Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen skill.

You can also speak, read, and write two additional languages of your choice.

#### Roving (6th Level)
Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

#### Tireless (10th Level)
As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.


{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page


## Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t stack the effects of a Fighting Style option, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Blind Fighting 
You have blind sight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Druidic Warrior
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. They count as Nomad spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the Druid spell list.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Thrown Weapon Fighting. 
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
- In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack and you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one. In addition, you no longer use your bonus action for your off-hand attack, instead you may use your off-hand attack as part of the attack action once per turn.




\column
## Spellcasting
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a Druid does. See Chapter 9 for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 10 for the Nomad spell list.

#### Spell Slots
The Nomad table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Nomad spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Nomad table shows when you learn more Nomad spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. 

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Nomad spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Nomad spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability 
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Nomad spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Nomad spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.



#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your Nomad spells. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.

\page

## Nomadic Tradition
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Beast Master, Gloom Stalker, Hunter, Monster Slayer, or Psionic Wanderer, each detailed in the following pages. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

## Primal Awareness
Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number of Nomad spells you know.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Nomad Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd | *speak with animals* |
|  5th | *beast sense*|
|  9th  | *speak with plants* |
|  13th  | *locate creature* |
|  17th  | *commune with nature*|
}}

You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Martial Versatility
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to Nomads. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

\column

## Land’s Stride
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell.

## Hide in Plain Sight
Beginning at 10th level, your ability to use camouflage to blend into natural surroundings reaches uncanny levels. This camouflage may take the form of a cloak made of specially patterned material; a coating of mud, plants, soot, or other naturally occuring materials; or another method of camouflage.

When using the Hide action, you can opt to not move on that turn and gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit after moving or attacking. If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden.



## Vanish
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

## Feral Senses
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.

## Foe Slayer
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

## Beast Master
The Beast Master embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and Nomad work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wasteland alike. Practicing the Beast Master's traditions means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.

##### Nomad’s Companion
At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (the Athasian Bestiary presents statistics for the baazrag, kes'trekel, and rasclinn as examples). Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your Nomad level, whichever is higher.

The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can tell the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.

While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, both of you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.

##### Exceptional Training
Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn’t attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turn.

##### Bestial Fury
Starting at 11th level, your beast companion can make two attacks when you command it to use the Attack action.

##### Share Spells
Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

## Gloom Stalker
Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest corners of Athas: deep under the earth, in the blood-soaked shade of Seedling jungles, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a Gloom Stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they reach the broader world. Such Nomads might also defend places where ancient evil lurks in the shadows, ever standing vigil.

##### Gloom Stalker Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the table below. The spell counts as a Nomad spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of Nomad spells you know.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Nomad Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd | *disguise self* |
|  5th | *spider climb*|
|  9th  | *fear* |
|  13th  | *greater invisibility* |
|  17th  | *seeming*|
}}

##### Dread Ambusher
At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier. 

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.

##### Umbral Sight
At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.

##### Iron Mind
By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

\column
::
##### Stalker’s Flurry
At 11th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.

##### Shadowy Dodge
Starting at 15th level, you can call on the shadows of the Black to dodge in unforeseen ways. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn’t have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.

## Hunter
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging klar and hordes of bandits to towering giants and terrifying silt horrors.


##### Hunter’s Prey
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

***Colossus Slayer.*** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

***Giant Killer.*** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature. 

***Horde Breaker.*** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

##### Defensive Tactics
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

***Escape the Horde.*** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

***Multiattack Defense.*** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.

\column
::
##### Superior Hunter’s Defense
At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

***Evasion.*** You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a tembo's death field or a *lightning bolt* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

***Stand Against the Tide.*** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

***Uncanny Dodge.*** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.

## Monster Slayer
You have dedicated yourself to hunting down creatures of the night and wielders of grim magic. A Monster Slayer seeks out vampires, dune reapers, malevolent wraiths, and other magical threats. Trained in supernatural techniques to overcome such monsters, Slayers are experts at unearthing and defeating mighty, mystical foes.


##### Monster Slayer Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Monster Slayer Spells table. The spell counts as a Nomad spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of Nomad spells you know.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Nomad Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd | *Hamanu's aegis* |
|  5th | *zone of truth*|
|  9th  | *magic circle* |
|  13th  | *banishment* |
|  17th  | *hold monster*|
}}

##### Hunter’s Sense
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to peer at a creature and magically discern how best to hurt it. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.


##### Slayer’s Prey
Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.

This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.


\column
::
##### Supernatural Defense
At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey’s assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target's grapple, add 1d6 to your roll.

##### Magic-User’s Nemesis
At 11th level, you gain the ability to thwart someone else’s magic. When you see a creature casting a spell or teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to try to magically foil it. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or its spell or teleport fails and is wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Slayer’s Counter
At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal effects.

## Psionic Wanderer
You have seen the dread things lurking at the edges of consciousness, the dream parasites and mindwiping psurlons that twist deep beneath the deserts. A Psionic Wanderer is the rarest of Nomads, able to merge their physical and magical training with a psionic arsenal that can withstand even the greatest of mental assaults. 

##### Dreadful Strikes
Starting at 3rd level, you can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring psychic energy, drawn from the keen edge of your focus. When you hit a creature with a  weapon, you can deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage to the target, which can take this extra damage only once per turn.

The extra damage increases to 1d6 when you reach 11th level in this class.

##### Psionic Wanderer Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Psionic Wanderer Spells table. Each spell counts as a Nomad spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of Nomad spells you know.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Nomad Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd | *command* |
|  5th | *detect thoughts*|
|  9th  | *intellect fortress* |
|  13th  | *dominate beast* |
|  17th  | *synaptic static*|
}}

##### Mind Trick
By 3rd level, your psionic qualities give you a curious charm. As a result, whenever you make a Charisma check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

In addition, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Performance, or Persuasion.

##### Thought Twist
At 7th level, long periods of practice in psionics has hardened your mind. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

In addition, whenever you or a creature you can see within 120 feet of you succeeds on a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you can use your reaction to force a different creature you can see within 120 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the save fails, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.


\column
::

##### Psychic Dueling
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. 

***Captured Potential.*** Whenever you succeed on a saving throw (even if you took damage) against an enchantment or illusion spell, a psionic power, or any power or spell that deals psychic or force damage, you can use your reaction to temporarily store the energy in one weapon of your choice. The energy remains stored within the weapon as long as you concentrate on it (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. 

Until the next time you hit a target with the chosen weapon, you have advantage on attack rolls with the weapon. When you hit a target with the weapon, you deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage and the stored energy is released. 

***Disruption.*** You can use your action to make a single weapon against a target that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the attack hits, the target takes an additional 3d6 damage. Additionally, the target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or it will be unable to manifest powers or cast spells until the start of your next turn. 

***Psychic Feedback.*** Whenever you take psychic or force damage, you can use your reaction to immediately reflect the damage back on your foes. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you takes psychic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Nomad level. 


##### Dream Stalker 
At 15th level, you can transform your physical body into pure psionic energies in one of the following ways.

As a reaction to a attack that would hit you and deal any damage but psychic, you become incorporeal until the start of your next turn, causing the attack to miss. 

Alternatively, you may become incorporeal for one minute as an action. The incorporeal condition ends early if you attack, use a psionic power, or cast a spell. 

While you're incorporeal in this way, you gain the following traits. 
- You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. 
- You gain resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage.

After using either the reaction or the action of this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

# Psion
Psions are erudite sages that master their psionic potential through study. Knowledge is power to a Psion, in the most literal sense possible. One’s thoughts and will can bend reality if one knows the correct way to think. Thus, Psions expand their psionic power to control the world around them.

## Eclectic Knowledge
Psions often consider themselves to be the ultimate psychics, capable of unlocking almost all forms of psionic ability. They can use these powers to communicate wordlessly across vast distances, manifest their thoughts into reality, or control the energy and matter around them. This focus on the mind often precludes them from paying attention to their bodies, typically leaving them less able to endure physical stresses. Thus, Psions typically choose to travel with more rugged, stalwart allies, so that the weak, material vessel of their supreme mind is sufficiently defended.

## Student of the Mind
A Psion is a mindbender at heart and shares much in common with Monks. However, where Monks study how to apply their psionics to the body, Psions look inward and seek to solve the puzzle that is the sentient mind and the pathways to power within it. With knowledge of the right techniques and practices, the mind is the most potent weapon in Athas, according to the Psion. 

## Creating a Psion
When you create a Psion, consider how you came to learn of psionic abilities. While psionics are common to the people of Athas, most are never able to develop their inherent abilities beyond the narrow, instinctual powers of a wild talent. Were you taught how to realize your psychic potential by a mentor? Or did you unlock the secrets of your mind through strict discipline, intense self-reflection, and personal study?

\column

## Psionics

You realize your psionic potential, gaining the use of talents and augments, the rules for which appear in Chapter 11. Psionic powers are magical effects.

#### Psionic Talents

A psionic talent is a psionic power that is a cantrip spell. You know three psionic talents of your choice from the Psion talent list, plus a bonus psionic talent determined by your choice of psionic discipline (see Psionic Disciplines). You learn additional Psion talents of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Talents Known column of the Psion table.

#### Augments

An augment is a psionic power that augments a psionic talent. You must be focusing on an augment’s corresponding psionic talent in order to manifest it. You know five 1st-level powers that augment the Psion talents you know.

The Augments Known column of the Psion table shows when you learn more augments of your choice. When the table indicates that you learn a new augment, you may only choose a power that augments one of the Psion talents you know. Each of these powers must have a minimum power level no greater than half your levels in this class when you learn them (round up).

For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn one new psionic power that augments a Psion talent you know, and that power can be up to 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose to replace one of your existing powers that augments a Psion talent you know and replace it with another power that augments any Psion talent you know. The new power can have a minimum power level no greater than half your levels in this class when you learn them (round up).

#### Psi Points

You have an internal reservoir of psionic energy represented by psi points. You must spend psi points from this reserve to manifest a power that augments a psionic talent.

The number of psi points you have is based on your psion level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Psion table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. When expending psi points to manifest an augment, you cannot reduce your current psi points to below 0. Your psi point total returns to your maximum when you finish a long rest.

#### Psi Limit

Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit to the number of psi points you can spend to manifest a power that augments a psionic talent. The limit is based on your Psion level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Psion table. For example, as a 3rd-level Psion, you can spend no more than 4 psi points when manifesting an augment, no matter how many psi points you have.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

#### Psion Talents

Below is a list of psionic talents available to Psions. The descriptions of these powers can be found in Chapter 12.

*blind spot*

*ectoplasmic object*

*energy ray*

*imbue psicrystal*

*inertial transference*

*mind thrust*

*mindlink*

*psychic hammer*

*sixth sense*

*speed of thought*

*wild technique*

## Psionic Disciplines

Choose a psionic discipline: Dominator, Kineticist, or Shaper. Your choice grants you a bonus Psion talent when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

## Power Siphon

You have learned to channel the magical power of mental effects into psionic potential. If you succeed on an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against any magical effect, you may use your reaction to regain a number of psi points equal to your psi limit. You can use this feature once, and must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Expanded Knowledge

By 6th level, you have studied your mind’s potential even further, stretching the boundaries of what is possible with your psionic might. You learn four psionic powers of your choice, any of which can be either a talent or an augment. The powers you choose can be from any class, including this one. An augment you learn with this feature must augment a psionic talent you know, including one you may have learned at the same time, and it must have a minimum power level no greater than half your levels in this class when you learn it (round up). 

The chosen powers count as Psion powers for you but do not count against the number of Psion talents or augments shown in the Talents Known and Augments Known columns of the Psion table.

You learn four additional powers from any class at 10th level and again at 18th level.

\column

## Power Surge

Starting at 11th level, you may sacrifice your physical health to briefly increase the potency of your psionic manifestations. When you manifest a psionic augment, you may reduce your maximum hit points in order to increase your psi limit for that manifestation by an equal amount. Initially, you may only use this feature once, but gain an additional use at 13th, 15th, and 17th levels. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The first time you use this power, the amount by which you reduce your maximum hit points and increase your psi limit is 2. Each time you use this feature again before you regain any uses of it, the amount increases by 2. For example, the second time you use this feature before finishing a long rest, you increase your psi limit by 4 and reduce your maximum hit points by 4.

Reductions to your maximum hit points caused by this feature are cumulative and last until you finish a long rest, and cannot be restored by any other means, including *greater restoration* or an intensified *revitalization*.

## Psychic Mastery

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery in a Psion talent of your choice. When you manifest a power that augments your chosen Psion talent, you may do so without spending psi points as long as the total psi cost for manifesting the augment is 5 or less.

## Dominator
Telepathy is the school of psionics that links one mind to another. While this can be a useful tool for fostering communication and fellowship, a Psion that focuses on this discipline believes telepathy is the most effective weapon in the arsenal of the mind. Weaker wills are like clay for a Dominator to mold.

##### Bonus Talent
When you choose this discipline at 1st level, you learn the *mindlink* talent. This talent does not count against the number of Psion talents you know.

##### Psychic Demand
Starting at 2nd level, while you are focusing on *mindlink*, you may expend 2 psi points to cast the *command* spell without using any components. When you do, *command* is a telepathy spell and you must target a creature you are telepathically communicating with. Additionally, you deliver the one-word command telepathically.

::::::::::::::::::

##### Mesmerize
Starting at 6th level, whenever a telepathy effect you use causes a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 psi points to give one target of the power disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the effect. Psi points you spend to use this feature do not count toward your psi limit when manifesting a power.

##### Subtle Control
Beginning at 10th level, whenever a telepathy power you used ends on a creature, or a creature succeeds on a saving throw to resist a telepathy power you used, the target creature does not realize you attempted to affect them or remember that you did affect them unless you wish for them to do so.

\column

##### Seize Concentration
Starting at 14th level, if a creature fails a saving throw to resist a telepathy power you used on it, and that creature was concentrating on a magical effect, you may expend 14 psi points (ignoring your psi limit) to seize control of that effect as a reaction. If you do, you may immediately choose new targets for the effect as if you had created it. If the effect allows a saving throw to resist it, the new targets make their saving throws against your power save DC. You may concentrate on the effect for its remaining duration. You can use this feature once, and must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

## Kineticist
Kineticists are experts in the mental manipulation of a certain kind of energy. They often go by more precise titles that indicate the kind of energy they specialize in. For example, if one focuses on controlling flames with their mind, they might call themselves a “pyrokineticist,” or a “cryokineticist” if they master freezing cold. Psions who harness lightning may refer to themselves as “galvanicists,” and ones who focus on creating intense blasts of thunderous noise might go by “kinetophonist.”

##### Bonus Talent
When you choose this discipline at 1st level, you learn the *energy ray* talent. This talent does not count against the number of Psion talents you know.

:::::::::::

##### Energy Specialization
Also at 1st level, you choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, lightning or thunder. The damage type you choose is your energy specialization which other Kineticist features make reference to.

##### Intense Ray
Starting at 2nd level, when you cast *energy ray* and chose to deal damage with your energy specialization, you add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

##### Energy Acclimation
Also at 2nd level, you gain resistance to the damage type of your energy specialization. When you reach 14th level, you gain immunity to the same type of damage.

##### Ardent Energy
Starting at 6th level, whenever a psychokinesis power you use deals damage with your energy specialization, you may spend 5 psi points to cause the power’s damage to ignore a creature’s resistance to that damage type, if any. Psi points you spend to use this feature do not count toward your psi limit when manifesting a power.

##### Inescapable Ray
Beginning at 10th level, if you cast *energy ray* to deal the damage type of your energy specialization, the target of the attack takes damage equal to your Intelligence modifier when you miss.

\column

##### Relentless Energy
When you reach 14th level, if you use a psychokinesis power capable of dealing damage with your energy specialization, you may spend 13 psi points (ignoring your psi limit) to treat a targeted creature’s damage immunity to your energy specialization as damage resistance instead. You cannot use this feature and Ardent Energy on the same manifestation of a psychokinesis power.

## Shaper
Psions who practice this discipline are experts in metacreativity powers that create sentience. Within the ethereal, undying haze of the Gray lies a realm comprised entirely of thought-matter, and Shapers draw that matter into the material plane, manifesting thoughts into reality.


##### Bonus Talent
When you choose this discipline at 1st level, you learn the *imbue psicrystal* talent. This talent does not count against the number of Psion talents you know.

##### Bonus Equipment
Beginning at 1st level, you start with an arcane focus crystal, described in Chapter 5, in addition to the equipment granted by this class and your background. This crystal fulfills the material component requirement of the *imbue psicrystal* talent.

##### Psychic Construct
At 2nd level, you learn the *project eidolon* augment. This does not count against the number of Psion augments you know. 

When you manifest *project eidolon*, you may reduce its minimum psi cost to 2. If you do, *project eidolon* augments *imbue psicrystal* as a 1st level power, and you manifest a weaker version of the basic eidolon, described below. 

{{monster,frame

### Actions
***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage.

}}

\column
::
##### Manifest Form
Also at 2nd level, you have delved deep enough into the realm of thoughts to understand how it defies the material plane's most fundamental laws, and channel that understanding into your psychic projections. Select one fundamental law which can be distorted by the creations you make using *project eidolon*: dreams, space, or time. Your choice cannot be changed, and it grants your eidolon one of the additional traits below:

***Night Aura (Dreams).*** The eidolon is cloaked in unnatural shadows, reducing lighting conditions around itself by one step (direct sunlight to bright light to dim light to darkness) in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. This aura does not hinder the eidolon’s own vision. Magical light produced by an effect of 3rd level or higher is unaffected by this reduction.

***Non-Euclidean Form (Space).*** The exact physical dimensions of the eidolon are hard to fully comprehend. Creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the eidolon until they hit it.

***Temporal Warrior (Time).*** The eidolon is made from the timeless essence of the Gray. It becomes immune to any effect that would reduce its speed, and it has advantage on saving throws to resist any effect that would slow it or move it through time, such as the *slow* spell or the *temporal shunt* power.

Additionally, on each of its turns the eidolon may shunt itself briefly through time as a bonus action, teleporting up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.


##### Manifest Function
Starting at 6th level, whenever you manifest *project eidolon*, the eidolon you create gains an additional way to use its action, depending on the distorted law you chose for the Manifest Form feature:

***Night Terrors (Dreams).*** The eidolon can provoke a waking nightmare in one creature it can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (against your power save DC) or suffer the effects of the *dissonant whispers* spell as though it were cast from a 4th-level spell slot. The eidolon can use this action once per manifestation.

***Maddening Distortions (Space).*** The eidolon can use its action to create a pulse of madness. Each creature within 15 feet of the eidolon must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (against your power save DC) or be affected as though by the *confusion* spell until the end of their next turn. The eidolon can use this action once per manifestation.





{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

***Temporal Stasis (Time).*** The eidolon can use its action to magically enfold a creature it can see within 60 feet of it in a field of null-time. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (against your power save DC) or be locked in stasis. A creature locked in stasis is paralyzed, immune to damage and all other effects, and does not age. Stasis lasts indefinitely, but the target may choose to repeat the saving throw at the end of any of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The eidolon can use this action once per manifestation.

##### Sustained Eidolon
Also beginning at 6th level, whenever you manifest *project eidolon*, the eidolon you project is automatically imbued with a modicum of your will, allowing it to sustain itself without your focus or effort. The duration of the power changes to Instantaneous when you manifest it, and the eidolon persists even if you stop focusing on *imbue psicrystal*, remaining in existence until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action. However you cannot cast *imbue psicrystal* while the eidolon exists, nor can you manifest a power that augments *imbue psicrystal* while the eidolon exists, even if you choose to maintain focus on *imbue psicrystal*. 

The eidolon can spend its hit dice to regain hit points during a short rest, and it can take a long rest by spending 8 hours in light or no activity. It also regains a single expended use of the action granted to it by your Manifest Function feature after finishing a long rest.

\column

##### Emancipated Eidolon
Starting at 10th level, when you manifest *project eidolon*, you can choose to invest the eidolon you project with a silver of your sentience. You can use a bonus action, instead of an action, to command an eidolon granted this sliver of sentience. It also regains a single expended use of the action granted to it by your Manifest Function feature after finishing a short or long rest.

Investing the eidolon with a piece of your sentience is not without risks, however. Should you choose to manifest the *project eidolon* power this way, and the eidolon is reduced to 0 hit points, it ceases to exist and you suffer psychic backlash as part of your psyche whips back into your mind, dealing psychic damage to you equal to half the eidolon’s maximum hit point total. This damage cannot be mitigated in any way.

##### Improved Manifest Form
Starting at 14th level, whenever you manifest *project eidolon*, the eidolon gains improved versions of the trait you grant it with the Manifest Form feature, depending on the plane you chose for that feature:

***Midnight Aura (Dreams).*** The eidolon is cloaked in magical darkness in a 30-foot radius centered on itself. Only magical light produced by an effect of 8th level or higher can overcome this darkness.

Additionally, magical darkness doesn’t impede the eidolon’s darkvision.

***Unspeakable Form (Space).*** The eidolon’s physical form is unspeakably alien and nearly impossible to fully comprehend. All creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the eidolon and the eidolon has advantage on all saving throws against any creature’s magical effects. If a creature deals damage to the eidolon, that creature’s attacks and magical effects are unimpeded by this feature until the start of the eidolon’s next turn.

***Temporal Dreadnought (Time).*** The eidolon controls the passage of time about itself. It becomes immune to any effect that would slow it or move it through time, such as the *slow* spell or the *temporal shunt* power.

Additionally, on each of its turns the eidolon may warp time around itself as a bonus action, teleporting up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, taking any object it is touching up to its maximum carrying capacity.

The eidolon may also take one willing creature it is touching with it when it teleports. A creature traveling with the eidolon in this way arrives in an unoccupied space adjacent to the eidolon. If there is no such unoccupied space, neither it nor the eidolon teleport. The eidolon can take a creature with it when it teleports once, and must finish a short or long rest before it can do so again.

# Rogue

Rogues come from all walks of life: slave, freeman, merchant, and noble. Rogues are common amongst merchant houses as astute guides, shrewd bargainers, and smugglers. Every city-state has a thieves' guild, and they often deal with Arcanists (no questions asked), who pay fees not only for illegal components but for protection and anonymity. Skilled Rogue performers are referred to as "bards," with the presumption they might also be serving as a covert agent or assassin.


## Skill and Precision
Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them explore ruins, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks. When it comes to combat, Rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A Rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks.

## A Shady Living
Everywhere has its share of Rogues. Most of them make a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists, often organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Others operate independently, only recruiting aid for particularly risky jobs, and a rare few may even make an honest living as locksmiths or investigators. As adventurers, Rogues can fall on either side of the law- some hardened criminals heading into the wastes for fortune or an escape from the law, others seeking their destiny in far-flung locales or exotic ruins.

## Creating a Rogue
As you create your Rogue, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guildmaster? Or did you leave your home in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?

What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to suddenly find yourself cut off from your familiar contacts? Maybe a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your war party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.

<div class='descriptive'>
 
##### Roguish Arts
Rogues have many features in common, including their quick reflexes, stealthy nature, and precision in combat-- but there exist a broad array of techniques behind their cloak and dagger ways. 

* **Arcane Trickster.** Some look on the ban of magic and all its useful tricks and think- "Well, what's another crime?" 

<br>

* **Burglar.** Thieves and pickpockets, the invisible standard-bearers of roguish activity.

<br>

* **Duelist.** Masters of one-on-one combat, unparalleled in battle and bar brawl alike. 

<br>

* **Mastermind.** As deft in political intrigues as they are in poison, with manners sharp as daggers.

<br>

* **Phantom.** Killing is common- Phantoms take souls, using the macabre forces of the Gray to walk as living wraiths.

## Expertise
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.

## Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. 

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

## Thieves’ Cant
During your Rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

## Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

## Roguish Art
At 3rd level, you choose a trade of the underworld, colloquially called a roguish art, that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Arcane Trickster, Burglar, Duelist, Mastermind, or Phantom, each detailed in the following pages. Your roguish art grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

## Steady Aim
When you reach 3rd level, you may use a bonus action to give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.


## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Evasion
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a tembo's death field or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

## Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

## Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

## Slippery Mind
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

## Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.

## Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Arcane Trickster
Some Rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. While this puts them in far more danger of Templar arrest, most Rogues already possess a healthy disdain for authority and think little of tacking more crimes onto their catalog. These Rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.

##### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See Chapter 9 for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 10 for the Arcanist spell list.

***Cantrips.*** You learn three cantrips: *mage hand* and two other cantrips of your choice from the Arcanist spell list. You learn another Arcanist cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

***Spell Slots.*** The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *charm person* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *charm person* using either slot.

\column

 {{width:7px}} ***Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.*** You know three 1st-level Arcanist spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the Arcanist spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Arcanist spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Arcanist spells you know with another spell of your choice from the Arcanist spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Arcanist spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Arcanist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

{{text-align:center
**Power save DC**:: = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Power attack modifier**:: = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
}}

##### Arcane Legerdemain
Starting at 3rd level, when you cast *mage hand*, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:
- You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.
- You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
- You can use thieves’ tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.

You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check.

In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.

##### Magical Ambush
Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.

\column

##### Versatile Trickster
Starting at 13th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.

##### Spell Thief
At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be an Arcanist spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can’t cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Burglar
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do Rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.

##### Fast Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

##### Second-Story Work
When you choose this roguish art at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

##### Supreme Sneak
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

##### Use Magic Device
By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.

##### Thief’s Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.

## Duelist
You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance. Fencers and pirates typically follow this art. A Duelist excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons while safely darting away from an opponent.


##### Fancy Footwork
When you choose this roguish art at 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

##### Rakish Audacity
Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. 

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don’t need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

\column

##### Panache
At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature’s Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.

If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can’t make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn’t hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.


##### Elegant Maneuver
Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.


##### Master Duelist
Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/YWF7Jrq/duelist.png' style='position:relative; top:460px; left:-725px; height:540px; width:650px;transform:scaleX(-1)' >

## Mastermind
Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many bards, courtiers, and spies practice this art, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are  your favorite treasures.


##### Master of Intrigue
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set Of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice.

Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.

##### Master of Tactics
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.

At 17th level, the range increases to 120 feet. 

##### Master of Deceit
At 3rd level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by making a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check. 

Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that determines if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic. 

##### Master Manipulator
Starting at 9th level, you have gained the ability to manipulate others both on and off the battlefield. As a bonus action you can either terrify or beguile your opponents with your words. The DC for this ability is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. 

When you terrify a creature, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. 

In order to beguile a creature, you must have spent at least 1 minute interacting with it before forcing the target to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is charmed by you for 1 hour or until you or one of your allies attack it. When the effect ends or if the target succeeds on its saving throw, it is unaware that you tried to charm it. 

After using this feature on a target, they are immune to its effects for 24 hours.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 


##### Misdirection
At 13th level, you've perfected the art of directing your allies in a pinch. When an attacker that you can see within 60 feet hits an ally with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against them. 

Additionally, if any allies within 5 feet of you are subjected to an effect that allows them to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, they instead take no damage if they succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if they fail. 


##### Master Strategist
Starting at 17th level, when using your Master of Tactics feature, the target of your aided attack deals additional damage equal to your sneak attack die. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest. 

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/WtV7nvN/mastermind.jpg' style='position:relative; top:360px; left:-395px; height:650px; width:480px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Phantom
Many Rogues walk a fine line between life and death, risking their own lives while taking the lives of others. While adventuring on that line, some Rogues discover a mystical connection to the Gray, the infinite expanse of ashen mist that serves as the afterlife on Athas. These Rogues, called Phantoms, can harness the knowledge and experience of those who have passed on, becoming so immersed in the Gray that they eventually become like ghosts themselves. Thieves' guilds value them as highly effective information gatherers and spies.


##### Whispers of the Dead
At 3rd level, echoes of those who have died cling to you. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can choose one skill or tool proficiency that you lack and gain it. You lose this proficiency when you use this feature to choose a different proficiency.

##### Wails from the Grave
Starting at 3rd level, you can channel the power of death to harm another. Immediately after you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the roll's total, as wails of the dead sound around them for a moment.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


##### Tokens of the Departed
Beginning at 9th level, you are able to snatch a token from departing souls when a life ends in your presence. As a reaction when a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll on the Trinkets table in Chapter 5 to generate it.

You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create one while at your maximum.

You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:
- While a soul trinket is on your person, you have advantage on stabilization saving throws and Constitution saving throws as your vitality is enhanced by the life essence within the object.
- When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets and then immediately use Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of that feature.
- As an action, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets and ask the spirit within one question. The spirit answers in its own tongue, knows only what it did in life, and may lie or leave out detail.


##### Ghost Walk
At 13th level, you can phase partially into the realm of the dead, becoming like a ghost. As a bonus action, you assume a spectral form. While in this form, you have a flying speed of 10 feet, you can hover, and attack rolls have disadvantage against you. You can also move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object. 

You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you end it as a bonus action. To use this feature again, you must finish a long rest or destroy one of your soul trinkets as part of the bonus action you use to activate Ghost Walk.


##### Death’s Friend
Starting at 17th level, your association with death has become so close that you gain the following benefits:
- When you use your Wails from the Grave, you can deal the necrotic damage to both the first and the second creature.
- At the end of a long rest, a soul trinket appears in your hand if you don't have any soul trinkets, as the spirits of the dead are drawn to you.

# Templar
Granted magical boons from their Sorcerer-King, Templars are one of the few magic users tolerated on Athas, if only out of fear. Many Templars hold high seats of power and are considered nobility, with some second only to the Sorcerer-Kings themselves. Most never reach such illustrious heights, instead spending their lives hunting rogue Arcanists in perilous, unseen service or handling mundane matters of governance. In exchange, they are empowered with the very essence of their Sorcerer-King, imbued with absolute authority over the lives and deaths of any who cross their path. 

## Servants of the State
Templars are civil servants within a segement of their city‐state’s government commonly referred to as a “temple" or "bureau". Each Templar swears obedience to their temple, and absolute fealty to their Sorcerer‐King. In return, the Sorcerer‐King grants them spell power stolen from ancient powers of Athas. In most city‐states, Templars are the ultimate authority—judge, jury, and executioner. Templars police and administer the city‐states, and serve other civil roles ranging from general or jailor to tax collector or garbage collector.

## One Truth Among Many
The reverence of Templars and their respective Sorcerer-King varies greatly with the city‐state. Some rulers, like Hamanu or Lalali‐Puy, claim they are gods and demand their citizens and Templars to worship them as such. Others, like Nibenay and Andropinis, only require service, not worship, from their Templars.

The behavior of the Templars themselves can vary just as widely- the city‐state of Kurn, for instance, only employs those who genuinely wish to protect and serve the people, whereas the Templars of Eldaarich are chosen only from the most brutal, cruel, and vicious members of the Templars' own families.

## Creating a Templar
When creating a Templar character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how were you selected for training? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you? 

Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character's adventures. Your patron's demands might drive you out into the world, or they may hound your every step as you pursue other goals. Be careful not to provoke your patron too far, for their wrath is beyond imagining.

Templars most often derive their power from the Sorcerer-Kings, each one of which tailors the powers to a form they prefer. If your Patron is one of the Sorcerer-Kings, you can use the table below to help determine the type of pact you receive. For more information on the Sorcerer-Kings, see Appendix B near the end of this book.

## Pact of Power
At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with a supremely powerful being, represented by the Pacts of the Almighty, the Ascendant, the Authority, the Deathless, or the Outsider, all detailed in the following pages. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

## Pact Magic
The power of your pact allows you to cast spells.  See Chapter 9 for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 10 for the Templar spell list.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the Templar spell list. You learn additional Templar cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Templar table.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Templar spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Templar spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.


#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Templar spells.

#### Spell Slots
The Templar table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your Templar spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *thunderwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Templar spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Templar table shows when you learn more Templar spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new Templar spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

 {{width:7px}} Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Templar spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Templar spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

## Eldritch Invocations
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain Templar levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Templar table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

## Pact Boon
At 3rd level, your pact of power bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

#### Pact of the Chain
You learn the *find familiar* spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. 

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, jarbo, nymph, or psionocus. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own.

#### Pact of the Blade
You acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle, and gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. 

You can also use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see Chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. The ritual takes 1 hour, and can be performed during a short rest. 

You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

#### Pact of the Talisman
Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can protect when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.

#### Pact of the Tome
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. Choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known.

If you lose your grimoire, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

{{note
##### Your Pact Boon
Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.

<br>

***Pact of the Chain.*** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its form can be a reflection of your patron, such as a bestial creature for a Templar of Hamanu or a minor elemental for a Templar who serves an Outsider.

<br>

***Pact of the Blade.*** If your patron is Nibenay, your weapon might be a slender blade with a pommel of a snake baring its fangs. If you serve Kalak, your weapon could be an axe with the head stylized as a different face on each side. 

<br>

***Pact of the Talisman.*** A talisman might appear as an idol, particularly for Lalali-Puy, or something as simple as a ring of bone, fitting for Dregoth. 

<br>

***Pact of the Tome.*** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged scroll, a heavy tome bound in hide, or perhaps even the tattered diary of a lunatic.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Eldritch Versatility
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:
* Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the Templar spell list.
* Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.
* If you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another Templar spell of the same level.

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.

\column

## Mystic Arcanum
At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the Templar spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more Templar spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

## Eldritch Master
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## Pact of The Almighty
To swear a Pact of the Almighty is no mere transaction- it is a religious devotion, binding your life and your death to a Sorcerer-King who claims godhood. These Sorcerer-Kings may craft their city-states into images of unimaginable paradise or utter perdition, but any who cross their will learn swiftly that gods do not tolerate dissent. In swearing this pact, you become an extension of your patron, healing their faithful and cleansing their opposition--just remember to say your prayers.

##### Expanded Spell List
The Almghty lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a Templar spell. The following spells are added to the Templar spell list for you.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Spell Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1st | *cure wounds, guiding bolt* | 
|  2nd | *flaming sphere, lesser restoration*|
|  3rd  | *daylight, revivify* |
|  4th  | *guardian of faith, wall of fire* |
|  5th  | *flame strike, hallow*|
}}

##### Bonus Cantrips
At 1st level, you learn the *light* and *sacred flame* cantrips. They count as Templar cantrips for you, but they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.

##### Healing Light
At lst level, you gain the ability to channel magical energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your Templar level.

As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

##### Radiant Soul
Starting at 6th level, your link to the Almighty allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell.

\column

##### Unwavering Resilience
Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points equaling your Templar level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your Templar level + your Charisma modifier.

##### Searing Vengeance
Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you would fall unconscious after your hit points being reduced to 0, you can instead revive with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Pact of The Ascendant
While the Sorcerer-Kings are best known for their unparalleled command of arcane defilement, all possess some measure of psionic talent as well. Some have delved deep into the mysteries of the mind, seeking powers best forgotten and the means by which to transcend the physical entirely. Your pact has put you in service of such a being, a fate of metaphysical mind games and lost knowledge that now haunts your every paltry thought. 

\column

##### Expanded Spell List
The Ascendant lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a Templar spell. The following spells are added to the Templar spell list for you.

{{classTable,frame,decoration

|  2nd | *detect thoughts, phantasmal force*|
|  3rd  | *clairvoyance, sending* |
|  4th  | *dominate beast, silt horror's tentacles* |
|  5th  | *dominate person, telekinesis*|
}}

##### Awakened Mind
Starting at 1st level, your psionic knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

##### Entropic Ward
At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Thought Shield
Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.

##### Create Thrall
At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s mind with the psionic magic of your Sorcerer-King. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a *remove curse* spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again.

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.

## Pact of The Authority
Among the Sorcerer-Kings, there is one thing that even their fiercest opponents cannot counter: authority. The singular force of will to command legions and break nations, to crush a populace until they beg to serve you. The Pact of The Authority is the most common among Templars, for base service is a deal made every day in Athas, often for far less. You bear your patron's authority forth into the world, a tool of ancient powers whose labyrinthine aims you fear to question.

##### Expanded Spell List
The Authority lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a Templar spell. The following spells are added to the Templar spell list for you.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Spell Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1st | *burning hands, command* |
|  2nd | *blindness/deafness, scorching ray*|
|  3rd  | *fireball, stinking cloud* |
|  4th  | *fire shield, wall of fire* |
|  5th  | *flame strike, hallow*|
}}

##### Soldier's Blessing
Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your Templar level (minimum of 1).

##### Unfinished Service
Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Battlefield Resilience
Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

\column

##### Gaze of the Sorcerer-Kings
Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to call upon your Sorcerer-King to skewer the unworthy with their potent, withering gaze. The creature disappears to submit to your Sorcerer-King's judgement, an experience from which none can emerge unscathed.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not allied to your Sorcerer-King, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Pact of The Deathless
You've made a pact with a deathless being, a creature that defies the cycle of life and death, forsaking its mortal shell so it might eternally pursue its  unfathomable ambitions. For such beings, time and morality are fleeting things, the concerns of those for whom grains of sand still rush through life's hourglass. Having once been mortal themselves, these ancient undead know firsthand the paths of ambition and the routes past the doors of death. They eagerly share this profane knowledge, and other bloodcurdling secrets, with those who work their will among the living.

##### Expanded Spell List
The Deathless lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a Templar spell. The following spells are added to the Templar spell list for you.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Spell Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|

}}

##### Form of Dread
Starting at 1st level, you can manifest an aspect of your patron's dreadful power. As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed:
- You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your Templar level.
- Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
- You are immune to the frightened condition.

You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your patron. For example, your form could be a winged, draconic shadow representing Dregoth himself, a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of Kalid-Ma, or your body might glow with glyphs from ancient funerary rites and be surrounded by desert winds, suggesting a mummified patron from the wasteland's buried ruins.

\column

##### Grave Touched
At 6th level, your magic has begun to transform your body. You no longer need to breathe, and  you halve the amount of food and water you require. 

In addition, once during each of your turns, when  you hit a creature with an attack roll and roll damage against the creature, you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using  your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.

##### Necrotic Husk
Starting at 10th level, your connection to undeath and necrotic energy now saturates your body. You have resistance to necrotic damage. If you are transformed using your Form of Dread, you instead become immune to necrotic damage.

In addition, when you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to drop to 1 hit point instead and cause your body to erupt with deathly energy. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your Templar level. You then gain 1 level of exhaustion. Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish 1d4 long rests.

##### Spirit Projection
Starting at 14th level, you can untether your spirit as an action, leaving the mortal husk of your body unconscious in a state of suspended animation.

Your spirit resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics but not your possessions. Any damage or other effects that apply to your spirit or physical body affects the other. Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit's space.

While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:

- Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- When you cast a conjuration or necromancy spell, you ignore all components without a cost. 
- You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain,  but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.
- While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Pact of The Outsider
You have made a pact with an Outsider, one of a rare few elemental spirits trapped away in the early days of Athas and now forced to entreat with you to secure their freedom. Such entities once ruled vast fiefs on the Elemental Planes, and know little of how far the elements have dwindled. They are varied in their motivations, but most are arrogant and wield power rivaling some of Athas' most fearsome beings. They wish nothing more than to be freed from their bonds, and will do anything to return to their rightful places. 

You choose your patron's kind or determine it randomly, using the table below.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| d4  | Kind  | Element |
|:---:|:-----:|:--------|
|  1  | Dao   | Earth   |
|  2  | Djinn | Air     |
|  3  | Efreet| Fire    |
|  4  | Marid | Water   |
}}

##### Expanded Spell List
The Outsider lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a Templar spell. The Outsider Expanded Spells table below shows the Outsider spells that are added to the Templar spell list for you, along with the spells associated in the table with your patron's kind: dao, djinn, efreet, or marid.


##### Outsider's Vessel
Your patron gifts you a magical vessel that grants you a measure of the Outsider's power. The vessel is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your Templar spells. You decide what the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Outsider's Vessel table.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| d8  | Vessel |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | Oil lamp |
|  2  | Urn|
|  3  | Ring with a compartment |
|  4  | Corked bottle |
|  5  | Hollow statuette|
|  6  | Ornate Lantern|

}}

\column

 {{width:7px}} While you are touching the vessel, you can use it in the following ways:

***Bottled Respite.*** As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with  cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.

***Outsider's Wrath.*** Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).

The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your Templar level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.

##### Elemental Gift
Starting at 6th level, you begin to take on characteristics of your patron's kind. You now have resistance to a damage type determined by your patron's kind: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).

In addition, as a bonus action, you can give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 10 minutes, during which you can hover. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

##### Sanctuary Vessel
Starting at 10th level, when you enter your Outsider's Vessel via the Bottled Respite feature, you can now choose up to five willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you, and the chosen creatures are drawn into the vessel with you.
\column



 {{width:7px}} As a bonus action, you can eject any number of creatures from the vessel, and everyone is ejected if you leave or die or if the vessel is destroyed. 

In addition, anyone (including you) who remains within the vessel for at least 10 minutes gains the benefit of finishing a short rest, and anyone can add your proficiency bonus to the number of hit points they regain if they spend any Hit Dice as part of a short rest there.

##### Limited Wish
Starting at 14th level, you entreat your patron to grant you a small wish. As an action, you can speak your desire to your Outsider's Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is 6th level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action. The spell can be from any class's spell list, and you don't need to meet the requirements in that spell, including costly components; the spell simply takes effect as part of this action.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish 1d4 long rests.

# Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in Arcanist and two in Fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

## Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Multiclassing Prerequisites
| Class             | Ability Score Minimum | 
|:------------------|:---------------------:|
| Arcanist              | Intelligence 13                     |
| Barbarian             | Strength 13                     |
| Cleric                | Wisdom 13                     |
| Crusader              | Strength 13 and Charisma 13                     |
| Druid                 | Wisdom 13                     |
| Empath                | Wisdom 13                     |
| Fighter               | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13                     |
| Icon                  | Charisma 13                     |
| Monk                  | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13                     |
| Nomad                 | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13                     |
| Psion                 | Intelligence 13                     |
| Rogue                 | Dexterity 13                     |
| Templar               | Charisma 13                     |
}}

## Leveling Up
When gaining a level, you choose which class to advance in. Levels are earned at the same rate regardless of how many levels a character may have in one class or another. 

\column

## Hit Points and Hit Dice
You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the Fighter and the Crusader have a d10, so if you are a Crusader 5/Fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a Fighter 5/Cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

## Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a Fighter 3/Rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

## Proficiencies
When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Multiclassing Proficiencies
| Class             | Proficiencies Gained |

| Arcanist              | ---                     |
| Barbarian             | Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                     |

## Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. The following features have additional rules when multiclassing:

#### Channel Affinity and Channel Vow
If you already have the Channel Affinity or Channel Vow features and gain a level in a class that also grants either feature, you gain the Channel Affinity/Vow effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a Cleric 6/Crusader 4, you can use Channel Affinity/Vow twice between rests because you are high enough level in the Cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Affinity/Vow effects available to you from your two classes.

#### Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the Fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the Templar’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't stack with the Extra Attack feature.

#### Psionics
Your psionic potential depends partly on your combined levels in all of your psionic classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Psionics feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Psionics feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

***Talents and Augments Known.*** You determine what psionic powers you know for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. When choosing new psionic augments for that class. use that class’s level or psi limit.

For example, if you are an Adamant Fighter 5/Kineticist Psion 3, you know two Adamant talents and four powers that augment those talents with a minimum psi cost of no more than 2, based on your levels in the Fighter class. As a 3rd-level Kineticist Psion, you know four Psion talents, including the bonus talent *energy ray*, and you know seven powers that augment your Psion talents, one of which may be a 2nd-level power, with the rest being level 1 powers. Additionally, as a 5th-level Fighter, you know *battle trance* and one Adamant talent, plus four powers that augment your Adamant talents that have a minimum psi cost of 2.

Each psionic talent you know is associated with one of your classes, and you use the power ability of that class when you cast that psionic talent or manifest any psionic augments to that talent. 

***Psi Points and Manifesting Psi Limit.*** You determine the maximum number of psi points your internal reserve of psionic potential can hold, as well as your psi limit when manifesting a psionic power, by adding together all your levels in the Empath and Psion classes, half of your levels in the Icon class (rounded down), and one third your Fighter or Monk levels (rounded down) if you have the Adamant or Order of the Soulknife features. Use this total to determine your maximum psi points and psi limit when manifesting a power by consulting the Multiclass Psionic Character table.

For example, if you are the aforementioned Adamant Fighter 5/Kineticist Psion 3, you count as a 4th-level character when determining your psi points and manifesting psi limit; you have a maximum reserve of 20 psi points; and your psi limit when manifesting a power is 4.

***Sublime Power/Power Surge.*** When your total psionic character levels as determined above reach 11th level, you must choose whether to gain the Sublime Power feature from the Empath class, or the Power Surge feature from the Psion class. You must have at least one level in Empath or Psion in order to choose its respective feature. Whichever feature you choose, you use your total psionic character level as determined above when determining the feature’s effects (such as the amount by which it increases your psi limit, and how many times you can use it), instead of your levels in any one class. Once you choose one of these features, the choice is permanent. You can never gain the other feature, nor can you gain the same feature twice from the same class.

#### Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

***Spells Known and Prepared.*** You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a Nomad 4/Arcanist 3, for example, you know three 1st-level Nomad spells based on your levels in the Nomad class. As 3rd-level Arcanist, you know three Arcanist cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten Arcanist spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a Arcanist) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six Arcanist spells from your spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

***Spell Slots.*** You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the Cleric, Druid, and Arcanist classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the Crusader and Nomad classes, and a third of your Fighter or Rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Profane Knight or Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like *burning hands*, has an  enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned Nomad 4/Arcanist 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level Nomad spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.

***Pact Magic.*** If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the Templar class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast Templar spells you know.

### Character Details

Characters are defined by much more than their race and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.

Your character’s name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.

:

### Name
Your character’s race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name, even if picking one from a list.

::

{{note
##### Names by City-State
In Athas' ancient history, many far-flung cultures flocked to the Tablelands to survive. The regions below offer inspiration for choosing a name based on your character's city-state of origin; this does not necessarily reflect any physical attributes of your character, only the different dialects that have resulted from the city-states' origins.

- Balic (Greek)

- Draj (Mesoamerican) 

- Gulg (Niger-Congo)

- Nibenay (Chinese)

- Raam (Indian) 

- Tyr (Phoenician)

- Urik (Babylonian/Mesopotamian)

:::::::::

### Sex and Gender Expression
You can play a character of any sex or gender identity without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to their broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a female-presenting Leonin character might expect deference from male-presenting Leonin on account of their matriarchal society. 

You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. Athas is host to any number of physical forms and gender identitites, and a character could as easily be androgynous or hermaphroditic as they could be masculine or feminine. You could also play a female character who presents herself in a masculine manner, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or someone who moves fluidly between different expressions of gender as befits the moment. Likewise, your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.

:

### Height and Weight
You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character’s ability scores might say about their height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.

:

### Other Physical Characteristics
You choose your character’s age and the color of their hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

### Alignment
A typical thinking creature has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by their society. 

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. 

**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for law. 

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. 

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems most practical at the time. 

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding  personal freedom above all else. 

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. 

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. 

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by base instinct and bloodlust. 

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments -- they are **unaligned**. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Dagorran are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

### Languages
Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your DM's permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.

## Personal Characteristics
Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity—will help you bring them to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.
:

### Personality Traits
Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting  and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your  character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in Tyr” tells you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.

Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, their past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of their ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.

:

### Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. 

:

### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals. 

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.

:

### Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

## Inspiration
Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to their personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.

:

### Gaining Inspiration
Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Inspiration can also be gained for stellar actions in combat, or simply a moment of  humor. 

You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

:

### Using Inspiration
If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

# Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your Fighter might have been a vicious bandit or a grizzled gladiator. Your Arcanist could have been a fugitive or a ruin delver. Your Rogue might have gotten by as a thief or plied the courts as a bard.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what *changed*? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have *more* money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

:

### Proficiencies
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in Chapter 6. In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in Chapter 5.

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, they can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

\column

### Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages” earlier in this chapter.

:

### Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from Chapter 5 to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

:

### Customizing a Background
You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. 

To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages. You can either use the equipment package from your background OR spend coin on gear as described in Chapter 5. 

Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create one.



<img src='https://i.ibb.co/b7WRkhF/Backgrounds.jpg' style='position:relative; top:475px; left:-715px; height:500px; width:700px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

### Adherent
You were trained to master ‘the Way’ at one of the many psionic academies across Athas, learning to harness the Will within you into a nexus of concentrated psionic energies. You are likely part of a noble or merchant house as few outside of these families are able to find, let alone gain access, these schools-- or perhaps you were taken off the streets, one of the rare few talented enough to be noticed and entered into the student body as a story of underdog success to later get peddled to the masses. 

**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Insight

**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools of your choice

**Languages:** One language of your choice

**Equipment:** Seal of graduation from a Psionic School made out of clay or similar material, a symbol or item denoting the noble or merchant family you belong to if you belong to one, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 ceramic tokens (ct)
 
**Feature: Tamed Talent**

Gain an additional Wild Talent of your choice.

:

### Artisan
One of the best ways for a slave to elevate their position is to develop and demonstrate some sort of artistic ability, such as singing, reciting poetry, painting, sculpting, and so forth. If they have enough talent, a noble or Templar might purchase the slave and treat them to a life of pampered luxury. In exchange, the owner expects the slave to produce beautiful works which will impress their friends and associates.

In most cities, it is common practice to secretly teach valued slaves the art of reading and writing, so that they may receive written missives and orders from their masters and communicate in kind. Of course, this privilege is only a gilded collar. Should an artist generate controversy or fail to keep up with shifting tastes, they quickly discover a literate slave has only two fates before them: execution for knowing how to read and write, or a sentencing to the gladiatorial pits as fodder. 

**Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two among Deception, History, Performance and Persuasion. 

**Tool Proficiencies:** One artisan's tool of your choice.

**Languages:** One of your choice.

**Equipment:** Set of artisan's tools, set of slave clothes, a pouch containing 5 ceramic tokens (ct) that you've managed to hide away.

**Feature: Creative Connections**

Word of your artistic skills has reached far, and you can easily acquire a buyer for your works or seek patrons for commissions. In addition, you are welcome at any of the underground communes of freed or escaped artisans spread throughout Athas. There you will find safe harbor, supplies, and kindred spirits eager for collaboration. 
:


### Bard
You thrive in front of an audience. You know how to entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them. Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you, awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Acrobatics, Performance

**Tool Proficiencies:** Disguise kit, one type of musical instrument

**Equipment:** A musical instrument (one of your choice), the favor of an admirer (love letter, lock of hair, or trinket), a costume, and a pouch containing 15 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: By Popular Demand**

You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble’s court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.

:
**Variant Bard: Arena Contender**

The wealthiest Templars and most noble families maintain stables of men and women picked and trained for their fighting prowess. These slaves are sent to fight in the gladiatorial stadiums for public entertainment. Their owners, sitting in private boxes perched high above the arenas, often wager considerable sums on the outcome of these battles. More than one noble has been sold into slavery for not being able to pay the debts he incurred when a favored gladiator fell.

If you were born into slavery then you were trained from your youth to do combat for the cheering masses. If you were sold into slavery then you were likely already an experienced combatant or physically exceptional enough to warrant the training you received.

A contender in the arena is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment—perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. You can replace the musical instrument in your equipment package with an inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a trident or net.

### Bounty Hunter
Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. You routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed.

You might be a cunning thief-snatcher, prowling rooftops for burglars. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves' guilds and street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. Or perhaps yours is the darker trade of the slave-catcher, hunting down those who have escaped their chains to return them either as property or bloodied warnings. 

**Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from among the following: Deception, Insight, Persuasion, Survival, and Stealth

**Tool Proficiencies:** Choose two from among the following: one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and thieves' tools

**Equipment:** A set of clothes appropriate to your work (common clothes, fine clothes, or traveler's clothes) and a pouch containing 20 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Ear to the Ground**

You've developed connections with the type of folk you tend to hunt among, whether they be bandits, street-folk, courtiers, or even Templars. You can find a contact for local information among your chosen group in any place they congregate.
:
### Charlatan
You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can have them emptying their pockets gladly. 


**Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Sleight of Hand

**Tool Proficiencies:** Disguise kit, forgery kit

**Languages:** One of your choice.

**Equipment:** A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, tools of the con of your choice (ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, a set of weighted dice, a deck of marked cards, or the signet ring of an imaginary noble), and a pouch containing 15 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: False Identity**

You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.


### Courtier
In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization. You might come from an upper-class family, or you might not; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.

Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of those that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Persuasion

**Languages:** Two of your choice

**Equipment:** A set of fine clothes and a pouch containing 10 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Court Functionary**

Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors you seek, and the current intrigues of interest in the group.
:
### Criminal
You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You’re far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Stealth

**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, thieves’ tools

**Equipment:** A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a pouch containing 15 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Criminal Contact**

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.
:
**Variant Criminal: Spy**

Although your capabilities are not much different from those of a burglar or smuggler, you practiced them in a very different context: as an espionage agent. You might have been officially sanctioned, or perhaps you sold the secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder. Replace the Criminal's gaming set proficiency with a poisoner's kit, and add one of the same to your background equipment. 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

### Delver
A delver learns about the long-lost and fallen cultures of the past by studying their remains – their bones, their ruins, their surviving masterworks, and their tombs. Those who pursue such ambitions travel to the far corners of the world to root through crumbled cities and lost dungeons, digging in search of artifacts that might tell the stories of monarchs and high priests, wars and cataclysms.

**Skill Proficiencies:** History, Survival

**Tool Proficiencies:** Cartographer's tools or navigator's tools

**Languages:** One of your choice.

**Equipment:** A wooden case containing a map to a ruin or dungeon, a bullseye lantern, a miner's pick, a set of traveler's clothes, a shovel, a two-person tent, a trinket recovered from a dig site, and a pouch containing 15 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Dust Digger**

When you enter a ruin or dungeon, you can correctly ascertain its original purpose and determine its builders, whether those were Dwarves, Elvhen, Humans, Seedlings, or some other known race. In addition, you can determine the monetary value of art objects more than a century old.

:

### Dune Trader

Merchants that travel between Athas' city-states through caravan routes, Dune Traders bring the necessities of life to every place where it's in short supply, from the cities of the Sorcerer-Kings to the most remote slave villages in the wastes.


**Skill Proficiencies:** Survival, and one of the following: Deception, Insight, or Persuasion

**Tool Proficiencies:** One artisan's tool of your choice.

**Languages:** One of your choice.

**Equipment:** A set of artisan’s tools, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 15 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Supply Chain**

Your travels through the wastes have given you various connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information.

:
**Variant Feature: House Membership**

As an established and respected member of a major merchant house, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow house members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.


\column

### Ex-Bandit
Your past is a sordid tale of robbery and bloodletting, making you well acquainted with risking life and limb for your chance at a share of treasure. Your experience makes you familiar with the rough edges of life in the wastes, but now you're looking for something else. Perhaps you crossed a bandit boss and were marooned out in the sands, or fled to save your skin, or perhaps you simply seek work that lets you sleep easier at night. 

**Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from among the following: Deception, Intimidation, Survival, and Stealth

**Tool Proficiencies:** Choose one from among the following: one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, or thieves' tools

**Languages:** Choose one from among the following: Sign Language or Thieves' Cant

**Equipment:** A set of traveler's clothes, a tool of the kind chosen from this background, and a pouch containing your last share of 10 ceramic tokens (ct)

**Feature: Gang Signs**

You know the bandit life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify bandits by their emblems, and you know a little about any such group, including the names and reputation of their boss and what marks they've hit recently. You can find the taverns and brothels where bandits roost in any area, so long as you speak the local language.

:

### Exile
You lived in seclusion – either in a sheltered community far from the city-states, or entirely alone, for a formative part of your life. Perhaps you were born to this path, perhaps you were forced into it, as an escaped slave, a political refugee-- the crimes of Athas are many if the wrong people are offended, and exile to the wastes is a tidy solution to many problems. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Medicine, Survival

**Tool Proficiencies:** Herbalism Kit

**Languages:** One standard language of your choice

**Equipment:** A scroll case stuffed full of notes from your travels, a waterskin, a set of common clothes, a tent, a herbalism kit, and a pouch containing 5 ceramic tokens (ct)

**Feature: Epiphany**

Your extended hermitage has resulted in a  unique and powerful discovery. You might have followed the trail of a forgotten Sorcerer-King, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might even be information dangerous to the people who consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return. 

Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

### Failed Merchant
Maybe you come from a long line of merchants. Perhaps you were an entrepreneur. Regardless. your ventures ended poorly. Whether it was because of outside influences, bad luck, or simply because your business acumen was weak, you lost everything.

With failure, however. comes experience. You're free of that old life, having made some connections and learned your lessons.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Investigation, Persuasion

**Tool Proficiency:** One type of artisan's tools

**Languages:** Any one standard language of your choice

**Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a set of fine clothes, a clay pot, and a pouch containing 10 ceramic tokens (ct) 

**Feature: Supply Chain**

From your time as a merchant, you retain connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants and entrepreneurs. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information.

:

### Folk Hero
You come from a humble social rank, whether having been forced into indentured servitude or forced to scrape at the feet of civilized society to survive. Your life has most likely been faught with abuse and near death experiences at the hands of Templars, nobles, and slavemasters alike-- however, you've found a way to stand out, for better or worse. Though you once pursued a simple life as a farmer, miner, servant, or some such profession, something has happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things. Determine what this event was and how it has impacted your life-- it may even have been this event which thrust you into the chains of slavery to begin with.

**Feature: Squalor Hospitality**

Since you come from the ranks of the lowest and most forgotten caste of society, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

### Heir
You are the inheritor to something of great value – not mere coin or wealth, but an object that has been entrusted to you and you alone. Your inheritance might have come directly to you from a member of your family, by right of birth, or it could have been left to you by a friend, a mentor, a teacher, or someone else important in your life. The revelation of your inheritance changed your life, and might have set you on the path to adventure, but it could also come with many dangers, including those who covet your gift and want to take it from you – by force, if need be.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Survival, plus one from the following: Arcana, History, or Religion

**Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument

**Languages:** Any one of your choice

**Equipment:** Your inheritance, the tool you choose for this background's tool proficiency, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 15 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Inheritance**

Work with your DM to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does. See the table below for some ideas.

The DM is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met.

When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you.

### Hired Hand
You are used to life on the road. You pride yourself at having traveled every major route in the Tablelands, and a fair share of its best backroads and shortcuts. When traveling these roads, you know where the best inns, campsites, and oases are located, as well as potential locations for dangers such as bandits or predators. Having worked the roads as long as you have, you have made many aquaintances and find it easy to pick up information and rumors floating from town to town. You are skilled with beasts of burden and handling and repairing wagons of all kinds.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Animal Handling, Survival

**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (Land)

**Languages:** One standard language of your choice

**Equipment:** A whip, a tent, a regional map, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 10 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Caravaneer**

You're always the first pick for the long haul, with a reputation for reliability and the kind of gut instincts that keep a traveler alive long enough to be called seasoned. Others recognize this and look to you for direction when a situation gets serious. You are able to identify the most defensible locations for camping. You have an excellent memory for maps and geography and can always determine your cardinal directions while traveling.

:

### Mud Rat
You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor, You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.

You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances and embark on a better life?

**Skill Proficiencies:** Sleight of Hand, Stealth

**Tool Proficiencies:** Disguise kit, thieves' tools

**Equipment:** A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember someone you lost, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: City Secrets**

You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.


\column

### Noble 
You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.

Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own--it's connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.

Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?

What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don't embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?

Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?

These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.

**Skill Proficiencies:** History, Persuasion

**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set

**Languages:** One of your choice

**Equipment:** A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a gaming set of the type you're proficient in, a scroll of pedigree, and a pouch containing 20 ceramic tokens (ct)
 
**Feature: Position of Privilege**

Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.

### Scholar
You spent years learning the forbidden knowledge of the written word, and have scoured proscribed manuscripts, studied heretical pamphlets, and listened rapt to underground lectures from radicals on the subjects that interest you. Your efforts have made you a master in your field of study, though you'd do best to keep it quiet. 

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Deception

**Languages:** One standard and one exotic langauge of your choice

**Equipment:** A bottle of black ink, a quill, a small knife, a letter from a dead peer posing a question you have not yet been able to answer, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Researcher**

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place such as a Sorcerer-King's vaults, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of Athas can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

:

### Smuggler
In a desert blind, you evaded a Trade Watch patrol with a hundred pounds of cured hides buried beneath you. You have sold ill-gotten wares to Templars and their Tarek bodyguards alike, and in your more charitable times transported slaves from their pens or helped guide folk into city-states by ways other than the costly, visible gates. 

**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History

**Languages:** Thieves' cant and one other of your choice

**Equipment:** A fancy leather vest or a pair of leather boots, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Down Low**

You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight situations. White in a particular town, city. or other similarly sized community (DM's discretion). You and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a secret.
\column
### Survivor
You are haunted by a trauma so terrible that you dare not speak of it. You’ve tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. The memories that haunt you can’t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. They might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a smell that refuses to fade, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. Occupying your hands can stay the symptoms for a time, but they always return. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two of Arcana, Investigation, Intimidation, or Survival

**Tool Proficiencies:** Choose one set of artisan's tools

**Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools, one trinket of special significance, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Pitiable Suffering**

Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.

:
### Veiled Auxiliary
The Veiled Alliance is a loose confederation of preservers working together to protect their members from assassination and harassment by Sorcerer-Kings and other defilers. The members work together to shield each other's identities from the authorities or to help those who have been discovered to escape persecution. They are often involved in plots to overthrow their oppressive overlords, and so keep their field agents on a need-to-know basis, with most called "auxiliaries" only given instructions through dead drops. 


**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Stealth

**Languages:** Druidic

**Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a forgery kit, a list of recent orders and passphrases, and a pouch containing 15 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Safe Haven**

As an auxiliary, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

### Veteran
War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a city-state's army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.

When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia? Did you emerge victorious and celebrated from your battles, or have you been weathered by loss and defeat?

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation

**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, Vehicles (Land)

**Equipment:** An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from a fallen enemy (a dagger, broken blade, or piece of a banner, etc), a set of bone dice or a deck of cards, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 ceramic tokens (ct)
 
**Feature: Speciality**

During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| d8    | Object or Item |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 1     | Officer               |
| 2     | Scout               |
| 3     | Infantry                |
| 4     | Cavalry               |
| 5     | Healer                |
| 6     | Quartermaster               |
| 7     | Standard bearer                |
| 8     | Support staff (cook, armorer, or the like)                |
}}
**Feature: Military Rank**

You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or mounts for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.

\column

### Wastelander
You grew up in the wastes, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the migration of herds larger than city-states, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wastes are in your blood, whether you were a Nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don't know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Survival

**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument

**Languages:** One of your choice

**Equipment:** A staff, a hunting trap, a trophy from an animal you killed, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 10 ceramic tokens (ct).

In addition, you have advantage on checks to find food and  water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers edible plants, small game, water, and so forth.

### Watchman
You are one of the many people that make sure the trade routes are clear at all times-- and at all costs. Most often you work independently, a lone ranger in the wastes, but larger problems might require a posse of fellow officers or local milita. You investigate potential ambushes and possible rumors as to someone wanting to rob or stop caravans. The bandits and brigands of Athas can often be hard to distinguish from common folk, and it takes a keen eye and careful tongue to track the proper path of justice. 

**Skill Proficiencies:** Investigation, Persuasion

**Tool Proficiencies:** Thieves Kit

**Languages:** Elvhen

**Equipment:** A thieves kit, a weatherbeaten yellow cloak, a badge of office, a watchman's uniform, and a pouch containing 15 ceramic tokens (ct).

**Feature: Investigative Services**

You have a special way of communicating with others and they seem to be at ease around you. You can invoke your rank to allow you access to a crime scene or to requisition equipment or mounts on a temporary basis. When you enter a town or village inside the Tablelands you can identify a contact who will give you information on the local rumors and would help you simply because of your desire to get answers and information for anyone wanting to disrupt trade. This sometimes comes at the cost of a minor bribe of 1-9 ceramic bits.

# Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. At each of these opportunities, you can forgo taking that feature to instead take a feat of your choice. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow —perhaps by a withering curse— you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

## Alert

You have studied the habits and motions of mindbenders with a practiced eye, allowing you to utilize gestures, body language, and facial expressions to suggest that your spellcasting is a form of psionics.

<br><br>

## Psionic Savant
You learn one of the following psionic talents: *ectoplasmic object, energy beam, imbue psicrystal, mindblade, mindlink, psychic hammer, speed of thought,* or *wild technique*. You also learn one 1st-level psionic power that augments your chosen psionic talent.

The spell must be on the Arcanist spell list, the spell’s level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 ct per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

{{chapter}}

# {{font-size:44pt Chapter 5}}
## {{font-size:24pt,font-family:MrEavesRemake Equipment}}


<div style='margin-top:52px;'></div>

The marketplace of a large city-state teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: Dwarven artisans and Elvhen hagglers, merchant stalls and government-owned armories alike. For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in Athas. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that will aid in your exploits. 
:
### Commerce and Currency 

To understand commerce and equipment in Dark Sun, one must understand Athas is a metal-poor world with only a handful of iron mines. Many items that would be crafted from metal are instead made from bone, stone, or ceramics. When thinking about commerce, consider its many forms-- gemstones, trade goods, art, animals, and property are all symbols of wealth and power.

Members of the peasantry, for example, hold wealth in practical, material forms, whether in direct currency or goods such as grain which can be bartered or used to pay tithe to the Templars. 

Members of the nobility, on the other hand, hold wealth in more abstract ways- either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine or custom house, or in jealously guarded reserves of rare treasures. 

#### Coinage
Virtually all city-states issue coins minted in tribute to their Sorcerer-Kings, but their value depends on the material. **Gold** is too scarce to make good currency, and **silver** is only slightly more common. Coins of either metal are thus rare and enormously valuable, typically reserved for the business of great nobles or city-state officials, and many Athasians go their whole lives without ever seeing one. 

The standard unit of measure for wealth is the **ceramic token (ct).** Templar-controlled kilns manufacture these ceramic tokens from clay, glazed in specific colors to discourage forgery. Notches on the “tails” side radiate from a center point so you can break the ceramic token into 10 pie shaped “bits.”  

With one ceramic token, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or an aprig. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one ceramic token a day.

\column


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 

A **bit**, the most prevalent coin among commoners, can generally buy a cheap night’s rest on an inn floor, a loaf of bread, or entry into a city state. An unskilled laborer might earn 1 bit a week. 

One bit is worth ten **lead beads**, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single lead bead buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. 

A standard ceramic token weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty ceramic tokens weigh a pound.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Exchange Rate

| Athasian Currency  |  ct  | 
|:------------------:|:---------------:|
|  Lead Bead (bead)  | 1/100th         |
|  Ceramic bit (bit) |  1/10th         | 
|  Ceramic token (ct)|  1              | 
|  Silver piece (sp) |  10             | 
|  Gold piece (gp)   |  100            | 
}}

### Starting Equipment
When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. Alternatively, you can start with a number of ceramic tokens based on your class and spend them on items in this chapter. See the table below to calculate your starting wealth.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Starting Wealth by Class
| Class  | Funds |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Arcanist  | 3d4 x 10 ct |
|  Barbarian  | 2d4 x 10 ct |
|  Cleric  | 3d4 x 10 ct |
|  Crusader  | 5d4 x 10 ct|
|  Druid  | 2d4 x 10 ct |
|  Empath  | 3d4 x 10 ct |
|  Fighter  | 4d4 x 10 ct |
|  Icon  | 3d4 x 10 ct |
|  Monk  | 5d4 ct |
|  Nomad  | 4d4 x 10 ct |
|  Psion  | 3d4 x 10 ct |
|  Rogue  | 4d4 x 10 ct |
|  Templar  | 5d4 x 10 ct |

## Armor and Shields
Athas presents a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to so-ut mail to costly braxat plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with one of many kinds of shields, split between simple and martial options. 

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor.

***Armor Proficiency.*** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

***Armor Class (AC).*** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

\column

<br><br>

***Heavy Armor.*** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. 

***Stealth.*** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

***Shields.*** Shields are made from a variety of materials, ranging from thick beetle shells to mekillot plates to reinforced bark, and are carried in one hand.

Any classes that would have proficiency with shields have proficiency with Simple Shields by default.

If you have proficiency with shields and martial weapons, you have proficiency with Martial Shields.

You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

### Light Armor
The lightest and cheapest option, worn by most Athasians, designed to trap moisture and maximize air flow.

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

***Padded.*** Commonly made by layering oiled canvas between silk, with a soft padding underneath. *Types:* kes'trekel feather, spidersilk, giantweave.

***Leather.*** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials. *Types:* inix, baazrag, jhakarskin.

***Studded Leather.*** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes made of bone or chitin.

### Medium Armor
More protection with less flexibility, more often used in cities than in the direct sun but also built with ventilation in mind allowing some to avoid overheating during exertion. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

***Hide.*** Crude but flexible enough for use in the sun, favored by many warriors. *Types:* tembo, kank, kirre, mekillot.

***Bone Mail.*** Stiff leather jackets adorned with small disks or squares of horn, bone, or wood. The kank and the cilops have hard body parts ideal for such coats. 

***Scale Mail.*** A heavy coat with carru leather leggings (and perhaps a seperate skirt), covered with the overlapping scales of a beast. The suit includes gauntlets. *Types:* scorpion, mekillot.

***Shell Breastplate.*** Fitted inix or mekillot shell pieces worn over supple leather. Legs and arms are left vulnerable but the vital organs are protected and movement unhampered. 

***Chitin Half Plate.*** Shaped chitin plates covering most of the body except the leg, which is protected by simple greaves held together by leather straps.

{{note
##### Armor and Extreme Heat
Extreme heat rules (see Chapter 7) will almost always apply every day in Athas. Characters exposed to the heat <u>and without access to water</u> must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour of exposure (DC 5 + 1 per hour after first) or gain a level of exhaustion. Those wearing Medium or Heavy armors have disadvantage on this save.

Anyone foolish enough to wear metal armor in extreme heat also requires double their normal allotment of water.

### Heavy Armor
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

Years of experimentation and clever crafting methods have led armorers to develop ingenious air ventilation and circulation methods allowing alternative armors to be worn in the heat of Athas, albeit with some drawback.


***Baazrag Mail.*** Hardened leather with the thick bones of boneclaw baazrags sewn within. While appearing massive and imposing, it is the least practical of the heavy armors.

***So-ut Mail.*** The scales of a so-ut are attached to a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath to prevent chafing and cushion blows. The hard scales provide superior protection to traditional scale armor.

***Mastyrial Splint Mail.*** The chitinous shell of the mastyrial is valued for its protective qualities. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of chitin riveted to a backing of leather over cloth padding, with flexible webbed hide protecting the joints.

***Braxat Plate.*** Braxat shell makes excellent armor plates that can be shaped to fit the body and interlocked. A suit of braxat plate includes gauntlets, greaves, a visored helmet, and thick padding underneath to cushion attacks. Buckles and straps  distribute the weight across your body. 

### Getting Into and Out of Armor
The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

***Don.*** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

***Doff.*** This is the time it takes to take off armor.

### Simple Shields
Simple shields are held by straps or a handle attached on one side, and used as basic protection against blows or missiles.

***Buckler.*** A buckler is made from thin wood, often overlaid with leather and braced with some kind of hide or chitin. It is an inexpensive and easy to make shield option, making it popular in every class of society.

Wielding a buckler increases your Armor Class by 1 against melee weapon attacks only.

***Focus Shield.*** The focus shield appears as a type of bracer which draws upon a spellcaster's arcane energy to create a small defensive field and act in place of an arcane focus. They are often issued to Templars but are extremely rare to see on non-sanctioned spellcasters, not least of all because of the attention it can bring upon the wielder. 

You may not wield a focus, weapon, or other object in the hand with a focus shield, but you may still make ability checks and skill checks as if your hand was empty.

The focus shield can act as a spellcasting focus, even for classes that normally cannot use shields as a focus.

You may not use a focus shield if you are wearing medium or heavy armor.

### Martial Shields
Martial shields have a more specific purpose than basic defense, and are thus equipped by experienced users.

***Spiked Shield.*** A spiked shield is made from wood or bone, and contains either a single large spike protruding from its boss or numerous smaller spikes placed closer to the edges.

A spiked shield counts as a melee weapon with the light property, dealing 2 piercing damage.

***Target Shield.*** A target shield is a large, round shield typically used by soldiers to guard against arrows or heavy blows. They are designed to resist splitting, making them pricier and less common outside of the city-states.

***Kite Shield.*** A kite shield is a large leaf-shaped shield designed for mounted combatants, with a rounded top and narrow, pointed bottom.

If you are attacked by a creature with a melee attack, but the attack does not hit, you may expend your reaction to make an opposed Strength check against the creature. If successful, you knock the creature off balance, giving the next attack against them advantage.

If you are mounted, you may add +1 to your mount's armor class.

***Tower Shield.*** A tower shield is a large, rectangular shield often used as portable cover. 

While wielding a tower shield, you cannot cast spells, and you have disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls you make that involve Strength or Dexterity.

As an action, you can plant the tower shield on the ground using its built-in stand, or lift it up and wield it as a shield. The wielder and one other creature can use the planted shield as three-quarters cover. 

Small or Tiny creatures cannot wield tower shields.

## Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the weapons most used in Athas, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

### Weapon Proficiency
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

***Ammunition.*** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. If tracking ammunition, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield after battle ends.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

***Disarming.*** A weapon with the disarming property is specially designed to disarm an opponent. They often have hooks, curved blades, angled spikes, or wrapping chains.

If you are proficient with a disarming weapon, you add your proficiency bonus to disarm checks while wielding it.

\column
<br><br>

***Double-weapon.*** If you are proficient with this weapon and you attack with it as part of the Attack action, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with the other end. This attack does 1d4 damage. 

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

***Heavy.*** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in Chapter 7.

***Loading.*** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

***Polearm.*** This weapon works with the polearm master feat.

***Range.*** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

***Reach.*** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. Creatures with at least 10' reach may make an Attack of Opportunity if a creature without at least 10' reach voluntarily enters its threatened zone.

***Secure.*** This weapon can't be disarmed from the wielder.

***Special.*** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. When the weapon is used with two hands, use the damage value presented in parentheses which appears with the property on the Weapons table.

## {{wide Melee Weapon Descriptions}}

 {{width:7px}} ***Alhulak.*** A blunt grappling hook attached to 7 feet of rope with a 2 foot-long handle. The bladed head is commonly carved from mekillot bone while the handle is wood or bone. 

***Battleaxe.*** A large broad-bladed axe.

***Carrikal.*** The sharpened jawbone of a large creature lashed to a haft, forming a sharp club with two forward facing heads.

***Club.*** A simple length of wood or bone used purely for blunt force. 

***Dagger.*** A short knife with a pointed and edged blade. 

***Datchi Club.*** This weapon, generally found in the arenas, is made by affixing a 4‐5 foot length of dried insect hive or roots to a three‐foot long shaft. Teeth, claws, or obsidian shards are embedded into the head of the weapon.

***Elvhen Longblade.*** A longsword with a curved blade designed for swift swings and precise thrusts.

***Flail.*** A farming tool consisting of a wooden staff with a short heavy stick swinging from the end.

***Greataxe.*** A massive axe with a double-bladed head. 

***Great Macahuitl.*** An oversized version of the macahuitl, often called the "obsidian sword" due to the sharp shards of obsidian embedded into the edges of the wooden core. 

***Gouge.*** Worn in an over-the-shoulder harness, this is commonly found in the Nibenese infantry. A wide blade is mounted to a 3-foot-long wooden shaft that requires two hands to wield. The weapon is wielded much like a shovel.

***Gythka.*** A Thri-kreen polearm with wicked crystalline blades at each end, wielded like a quarterstaff. Like the chatkcha, few outside the Thri-kreen know how to wield one, and its manufacture is a closely guarded racial secret.

***Handaxe.*** A small axe with a sharpened stone on one end, often used for chopping wood. 

***Javelin.*** A sharp-tipped, lightweight throwing spear.

***Khopesh.*** A sickle-like blade featuring both sharp and blunt edges, with an axe-like curve and a hooked tip.

***Light hammer.*** A small sledge hammer no larger than a foot and a half at the haft.

***Lotulis.*** Two barbed, crescent-shaped blades adorn either end of the lotulis, a long weapon popular in the arena of Tyr. 

***Macahuitl.*** A macahuitl is a sword painstakingly crafted using a core of solid wood, with small, sharp shards of obsidian embedded into the wood to form an edge on two opposite sides of the weapon. The macahuitl is especially popular among the Draji, who seem to be the only ones who can easily pronounce this weapon’s Draji name (“ma‐ka‐wheet‐luh”). Non‐Draji simply refer to it as the “obsidian sword” or the “Draji sword.”

<br>
:
 {{width:7px}} ***Mace.*** A heavy club with a flanged or spiked head to inflict brutal wounds. 

***Maul.*** A maul is effectively a very large sledgehammer that crushes opponents to death. This weapon is commonly used by Duls, Dwarves, Tareks, and other creatures that value great strength.

***Morningstar.*** A club with a heavy spiked head which is attached to the handle by a chain. 

***Puchik.*** A bone or obsidian punching dagger.

***Quabone.*** Four jawbones are fastened around a central haft, at right angles to one another. The quabone is often used in the arenas. The wounds it inflicts are non‐lethal, yet have entertainment value, as the quabone tends to open up many small cuts that bleed freely for a brief time.

***Quarterstaff.*** A stout pole used as both walking staff and blunt weapon. 

***Shortsword.*** A sword generally shorter than 30 inches but longer than a dagger. 

***Sickle.*** A short-handled farming tool with a semicircular blade.

***Slodak.*** The slodak is a wooden short sword, carved from young hardwood trees and treated with a mixture of tree sap and id fiend blood. This treatment renders the blade of the weapon extremely strong, making it a deadly weapon.

***Spear.*** A thrusting or throwing weapon with a long shaft and sharp, pointed head.

***Swatter.*** The swatter is a popular name for a Tarek weapon consisting of a heavy spiked club made from hardwood, with a bronze or lead core in the tip for added weight. The swatter got its name from the tales of a Tarek soldier who reputedly used a similar weapon to defeat an entire Thri‐kreen hunting party.

***Thanak.*** The thanak is a chopping weapon of pterran manufacture resembling a jagged sword or sawblade. It consists of a pair of hardwood strips bound together, with a row of pterrax teeth protruding from between them along one edge of the weapon particularly capable of slicing through muscle and sinew.

***Trikal.*** Three blades radially project from the business end of a 6 foot shaft. A series of sharp, serrated edges line the shaft below the blades while the far end of the weapon is weighted to balance it.

***Trident.*** A three-pronged spear popular in gladiatorial combat. 

***War Pick.*** An anti-armor weapon with a pointed tip on one end of its head and a hammer on the other. 

***Warhammer.*** A long-handled weapon with a heavy head, blunt on one end and spiked on the other. 

***Whip.*** A strip of leather or lengths of cord fastened to a handle, used to flog a person or animal.

#### Exotic Weapons
Exotic weapons are not widely available and thus few can teach how to properly use them. You do not have proficiency with exotic weapons unless your background would allow it or you find a mentor capable of teaching you.

{{note
##### Special Weapon Materials
There are no silvered or adamantine weapons available for sale on Athas. Such relics, if they ever existed, would be in the vaults of the richest merchant houses or a Sorcerer-King, or lost beneath the ruins of a civilization gone eons ago.

Metal weapons, on the other hand, do exist within Athas- they are extremely rare however, and are best represented mechanically as a +1 magic weapon or the like. 
}}

#### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead body.

In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use their proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

## Ranged Weapon 
## Descriptions

 {{width:7px}} ***Blowgun.*** A tube of wood, bone, or hollowed horn used to fire darts by breath alone. 

***Crossbow, hand.*** A rare variant of the crossbow which fires with less force but is able to be concealed and used with one hand.

***Crossbow, heavy.*** A bow fixed to a stock, often accompanied by a stirrup which assists with the tension required to load bolts. 

***Crossbow, light.*** A lighter variant of the crossbow, firing bolts with less force but also requiring less strength to arm and carry.

***Dart.*** A small pointed missile that can be thrown. 

***Dejada.*** A long, scooped basket is worn on the arm and used to propel 2-inch ceramic or stone projectiles called “pelota” at high speed.

***Longbow.*** A tall wooden bow able to fire with great range and accuracy. 

***Shortbow.*** A smaller bow which can be drawn with greater ease but cannot fire nearly as far.

## Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.

***Bola.*** A bola consists of a length of cord with weights on each end or three to six weights tied to a center point. A creature hit by a bola is grappled until it is freed. A bola has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the bola (AC 10) also frees the creature harmlessly by destroying the bola.

***Boomerang.*** This curved piece of carved wood is specially designed to return after being thrown. On a missed attack, the boomerang will return to its thrower if there are no obstacles in its path.

***Cahulak.*** A pair of alhulak heads tied to either end of a 12-foot rope. As a melee weapon, the wielder holds one blade cluster in each hand and swings them at the foe. This type of weapon can be used in the following ways:

- Holding each end of the Cahulak counts as having two one-handed light melee weapons.

- Holding only one end allows you to make a one handed weapon attack with reach.

- It can also be thrown, tangling around the target like a net and dealing 1d6 damage.

 {{width:7px}} ***Carvewhip.*** The carvewhip is usually braided from giant hair or leather, and has shards of chitin, obsidian or bone braided into the end of the whip. Unlike normal whips, the carvewhip deals damage normally, has only a ten‐foot range, and you apply your Strength modifier to damage dealt. In all other respects, it is treated as a normal whip.

***Chatkcha.*** This 3-bladed crystalline throwing wedge is made exclusively by Thri-kreen in a secret, carefully guarded process. In their language, it means “rememberer-who-ends-knowledge,” reflecting it ends awareness by killing and remembers to return to its thrower. Due to its spin it will return to a proficient thrower if it misses.

***Dragon's Paw.*** Popular in the arenas, the dragon’s paw consists of a five or six‐foot long pole, with a blade on either end. A basket guards your hands from attack, granting a +2 bonus on all attempts to defend against being disarmed.

***Forearm Axe.*** Worn on the forearm, this weapon consists of a large, double-bladed axe on either end of a bracer with a spike protruding perpendicularly from the upper sheath.  You may continue to use your hand normally, but you cannot wield a shield with the same arm or attack with the forearm axe and a wielded weapon in the same hand in one round. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of a forearm axe.

 {{width:7px}} ***Garrote.*** A short piece of thick wire or rope with handles at the ends, used for choking victims to death. On a hit, the target is grappled. Until the grapple ends, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of your turn. You cannot make weapon attacks while grappling a creature in this way.

***Lajav.*** The lajav is a Thri-kreen weapon designed to capture opponents. It incorporates two flattened bones, joined in a hinge about two feet from the end. The result looks something like a nutcracker, and is used roughly in the same crushing way. If you hit an opponent at least one size category smaller than yourself with a lajav, you can immediately initiate a grapple (as a free action) without provoking an attack of opportunity. Regardless of your size, you need two hands to use a lajav, since a second hand is required to hold the other end of the lajav.

***Lance.*** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.

***Lasso.*** This weapon consists of 60ft of rope that you throw and then draw closed. Throwing a lasso is a ranged touch attack. If you successfully hit your opponent, make a grapple check. If you succeed at the grapple check, then your opponent is grappled, and you can continue the grapple contest by continuing to pull on the rope. You can make trip attacks with a lasso against a grappled opponent. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the lasso to avoid being tripped.

***Net.*** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

***Singing Sticks.*** Carefully crafted and polished thin clubs, often used in pairs, named for their characteristic whistling noises when used. They make enough noise to attract attention if used while hiding. 



\column

***Skyhammer.*** The sky hammer consists of a 10‐foot length of rope with a large hammer‐like object at one end. Its rope is coiled and swung around the body two‐handedly until enough momentum is gained to hurl the hammer at a target. A successful hit grants a free trip attempt, and you receive a +4 bonus to your opposed Strength roll due to the momentum of the skyhammer.

***Splashbow.*** This exotic weapon looks like a misshapen crossbow, only three feet long from bow to stock, but with a horizontal bow nearly five feet wide. Rather than bolts, the splashbow fires hinged pelotas, which are filled with splash–globes of acid, alchemical fire, or contact poisons. Splash–globes burst on impact, functioning as an acid flask, alchemist's fire, or contact poison depending on the ammunition. The splashbow takes a full round to draw and load, assuming that the hinged pelotas have already been prepared.

***Talid.*** Also known as the “gladiator’s gauntlet,” this is made of stiff leather with chitin or bone plating on the hand cover and along the forearm. Spikes protrude from the knuckles and along the back of the hand. A sharp blade runs along the thumb and there is a 6 inch spike on the elbow. Melee attacks with this weapon count as unarmed strikes and deal one damage die higher then normal (to a maximum of a d12).

***Tkaesali.*** This polearm, commonly used by the nikaal, consists of a long wooden haft topped with a circular, jagged blade. A tkaesali has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.

***Tonfa.*** The tonfa is a baton with a short handle, and is popular among street‐patrolling Nibenese Templars and their guards. You can deal nonlethal damage with a tonfa without the usual –4 penalty.

***Tortoise Blade.*** A short blade attached to the shell of a desert tortoise. It straps to the forearm and provides +1 to armor class like a buckler. A magical bonus to this weapon (such as a +1 version) increases the bonus to AC accordingly. It cannot be combined with a regular shield (the better bonus applies). If worn as a pair, you gain an additional +1 to AC and can use them with two-weapon fighting as if they had the Light property. 

***Widow's Knife.*** Named for its results, this weapon has a wide blade on one end of a wood or an ivory handle. Hidden within the handle are two spring-loaded prongs. On a successful hit, you may trigger the prongs by releasing a catch in the hilt as a free action. The prongs do an additional 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small widow’s knife) when sprung, and take a standard action to reload.

***Wrist Razor.*** Wrist razors consist of a trio of blades that protrude from a heavy arm band. The razors project out over the back of the hand, are extremely sharp, and can be up to 6 inches long. Wrist razors can be worn on one or both forearms. Melee attacks with this weapon count as unarmed strikes and deal one damage die higher then normal (to a maximum of a d12).

## Gear Descriptions
This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.


***Acid.*** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. 

***Alchemist’s Fire.*** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

***Antitoxin.*** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.

***Arcane Focus.*** An arcane focus is a special item— an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item— designed to channel the power of arcane spells. An Arcanist or Templar can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as described in Chapter 9.

***Arcanic Water.*** As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the flask as an improvised weapon. If the target is an elemental, fey, or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.

A character with the Spellcasting class feature may create arcanic water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 ct worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.

***Ball Bearings.*** As an action, you can spill these tiny stone balls from their pouch to cover a level area 10 feet square. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.

***Block and Tackle.*** A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.

***Book.*** A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on strange contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).

}}

 {{width:7px}} ***Caltrops.*** As an action, you can spread a single bag of bone caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage.

 {{width:7px}} ***Hunting Trap.*** When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed bone ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into solid ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.

***Manacles.*** These restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check.

 {{width:7px}} ***Mess Kit.*** This latching box contains a cup and simple cutlery. One side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

***Oil.*** Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

 {{width:7px}} ***Potion of Healing.*** A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Administering a potion to another character takes an action and requires the imbiber to roll for healing, but characters have the choice of using an action or a bonus action when drinking a potion themselves.

***Spellbook.*** Essential for Arcanists, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.

***Splash-globes.*** Splash‐globes are spherical glass jars containing contact poison or up to half a pint of alchemical fluid. In addition to bursting on impact like any grenade, splash‐globes can be placed in hinged pelota, thus giving the grenade additional range when launched from a splashbow or dejada. 

***Spyglass.*** Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.

***Tent.*** A simple and portable canvas shelter. A tent sleeps two.

***Tinderbox.*** This small container holds flint, striker, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

***Torch.*** A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

## Tools
A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

# Mounts and Vehicles
A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wastes, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity.

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.

:

## Mount Descriptions

 {{width:7px}} ***Carru.*** A strain of humped cattle with a bony skull and drab hide. With many products and resources being derived from it, the carru is a staple of Athasian life. The carru’s hump is used for water storage and holds 1d6 + 2 pints of water at any given time.
 
:

 {{width:7px}} ***Crodlu.*** A crodlu is a large reptilian animal used for transportation or as a beast of burden. It resembles an enormous scaled ostrich, its limbs tipped with wicked claws. Heavy crodlu are bred for carrying Medium humanoids or pulling larger passengers and cargo. Warmount crodlu are powerful beasts raised for combat.

:

 {{width:7px}} ***Erdland.*** These flightless, featherless birds are covered with red to gray scales and often stand nearly 15 feet tall. The legs of an erdland are powerful and strong, sporting large four-clawed feet. Erdlands are not capable of fast speeds and are used more for their endurance than their speed. Erdlands can be hitched to wagons individually or in teams. An erdland is appropriate as a mount for a Medium humanoid creature and can be ridden into battle. 

:

 {{width:7px}} ***Erdlu.*** Erdlus are smaller relatives of erdland, used as herd beasts by many different cultures on Athas. They stand 7 feet tall and weigh around 200 lbs. An erdlu is the appropriate size to function as a mount for a Medium humanoid, but are skittish and hard to control in battle. Their scales, claws and meat make them valued as sources of various commodities.  The price of a single erdlu can be as much as double that listed or as little as half, depending upon availability. Erdlu eggs are also edible; one egg can fetch 8 bits.

:

 {{width:7px}} ***Inix.*** The inix is a large, 16-foot-long reptile commonly used for riding and as a beast of burden. Though herbivorous by nature, inix are vicious combatants, attacking with both tail and bite. Inix trained for riding are also trained not to fight while mounted, for no rider could manage to keep his seat while an inix thrashed its mighty tail.

 {{width:7px}} Inix are commonly used in the armies of the Sorcerer-Kings and as mounts and escorts for the caravans of the great merchant houses and dune traders. An inix can be trained to carry a howdah or bear a Large rider with a specially constructed saddle. Tareks use them as individual mounts; they are one of the few beasts able to carry a Tarek comfortably. Inix can’t generally pull wagons because of their lengthy tails.
 
Every day that an inix doesn’t receive its fill of water or food, it must save vs. death or go berserk. The animal’s basic saving throw is 11, but there is a cumulative –2 penalty on the save imposed with each passing day. The berserk inix’s aim is not to eat its masters, but to escape to forage elsewhere. However, it will attack those who try to stop it – once berserk, an inix must be either set free, magically or psionically charmed, or killed. The chance for an inix to go berserk is in addition to dehydration.  
 
:

 {{width:7px}} ***Kank.*** Kanks are large, docile insects used as herd animals and beasts of burden. They are effective mounts for a single Medium character. Kanks are 4 feet high and 8 feet long, weighing 400 pounds, durable and easily tended. Kanks are not raised for their meat, which becomes foul-smelling as soon as they die. Instead, they are raised for honey globules produced on their bellies – each globule is worth 4 bits – and for chitin.

All kank mounts are of the food-producer variety, creating large globules of green honey on the abdomen every other day; it can be eaten by all the player character races and counts as one gallon of water. Characters on a strict diet of kank honey can survive on it alone for a period of days equal to their Constitution modifier; after that, the character’s diet must be supplemented with other foodstuffs or they will become ill. A kank that is dehydrated or underfed does not produce honey.

 {{width:7px}} ***Mekillot.*** A mekillot is an enormous six-ton lizard used as a beast of burden or to transport troops. A mekillot can be fitted with a pack or war howdah, carrying several men into combat. These beasts are hard to control and usually require a psionic handler in addition to a tremendous amount of food and water. Mekillots instinctively drop on their bellies should something move beneath them, Wise Athasians know never to come between a mekillot and the ground.

 When in use as a pack animal, a mekillot may decide to stop working or to move in a random direction. Each day, roll 1d20. On a roll of one, the mekillot stops where it is and won’t move further that day. On a roll of two, the mekillot takes a new direction not given to it. Exactly when the mekillot becomes stubborn is determined randomly (roll 1d10 for the ten-hour march day). A stubborn mekillot can sometimes be controlled through magic or psionics. Any physical effort to change a mekillot’s mind (a beating, attempting to lure it with food, etc.) enrages it and causes it to attack. A mekillot cannot be pushed to double or triple its normal movement.

## Caring for Mounts
Athas’ beasts are hardy, savage creatures; their handlers must establish an uneasy peace, hoping to balance the burdens asked of their beasts with the allure of steady food and water.

#### Feed
A creature's daily feed consumption is based on their size. Food for creatures is usually dried and of low quality. Medium sized creatures need 1 to 2 pounds of feed per day, Large creatures need 3 to 4 pounds, Huge creatures need 7 to 8 pounds, and Gargantuan creatures need 15 to 16 pounds per day. 

Average costs for these supplies are shown shown in the Feed, Tack, and Harness table. If allowed to graze for a day in scrub plain, forest, or verdant belt terrain, most mounts will be able to forage enough food for themselves. Some creatures, such as erdlu or kanks, can forage effectively in any terrain except salt flats.  

#### Dehydration
Animals also suffer dehydration. Each day, animals require the following quantities of water: Tiny animals need 1/8 gallon, Small animals need 1/2 gallon, Medium animals need 1 gallon, Large animals need 4 gallons, Huge animals need 8 gallons, and Gargantuan animals need 16 gallons. Animal water intake can be cut in half for shade or inactivity, or quartered for both. 

At the end of a day that an animal doesn’t get its full water allotment, there is a 10% chance it will die; the chance increases by 10% for each additional day without water. Animals are fully rehydrated after receiving their full allotment of water for one day.

}}

 {{width:7px}} ***Barding.*** A mount's defense can be reinforced by covering it with barding. Made of leather pads with bone, chitin, or wood plates, barding increases a mount's Armor Class by 2.

***Saddles.*** A pack saddle adds fifty pounds to the creature's base carrying capacity.
A riding saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted.

***Stabling.*** Housing, feeding, and watering of animals is offered in all of the major cities. Inix and Mekillot stabling is not always available in villages, unless they are on major trade routes.

## Vehicle Descriptions

 {{width:7px}} ***Cart.*** A two-wheeled transportation vehicle, small enough to be pulled by a single character or creature of Medium or greater size. 

***Chariot.*** A chariot is a lightly armored vehicle constructed of wood, chitin and hardened leather, designed for riding and combat. Two people can ride a chariot. A creature riding a chariot has half cover against attacks from the front or the sides. Crodlu and kanks
can be used to pull a chariot.

***Howdah.*** A howdah is a frame with seats designed to be mounted on the back of an inix or mekillot. Howdahs do not count against a creature's carrying capacity, unlike riders and cargo. A normal howdah is made of a light wooden frame while a war howdah is constructed of much sturdier materials designed for battle, offering half cover against any attacks from outside. An inix howdah can hold a driver and up to four additional people. A mekillot howdah can be constructed in a more elaborate affair; it often contains two levels and can accommodate up to sixteen people. Anyone riding in a howdah is considered to be at rest and shaded.

***Sand skiff.*** Sand skiffs are three or four-wheeled, single-masted vehicles built to harness the danger and fury of a sandstorm for the sake of travel across the desert wastes. They often require a great deal of maintenance to cope with the sail-cutting winds and volatile terrain of Athas, but these trifling concerns matter little to the bandits and raiders that favor the skiff over costly, troublesome beasts. Their sizes vary, from nimble three-person gliders and offense-minded six-person rams to hulking barges with a crew of twelve or more. 

***Silt skimmer.*** Silt skimmers are essentially huge wagons that roll across narrow shoals within the Silt Sea, shallow paths where rock and hardened silt can support weight. Skimmers of this sort are largely driven by massive, hollow wheels, with slaves or undead in their center churning a set of circulating "stairs" to provide power. When weather conditions are favorable, sails may also be mounted to propel the skimmer across the silt. In either manner, silt skimmers can cover distances of six to eight miles in a day. However, they are still limited to the shoals of the Silt Sea, unable to cross loose silt deeper than 15 feet. 

Though a great deal more expensive, there are silt skimmers equipped with obsidian engines that allow travel to be powered by psionics rather than manual labor. To operate such crafts, a wild talent or mindbender must channel their psionic energy through an enchanted, symmetrical piece of obsidian that distributes the energy across the skimmer's hull. The silt then supports the ship and moves the skimmer at whatever speed the pilot desires, allowing travel at any depth. 

***Wagon.*** A wagon is the simplest form of transportation. Crodlus or kanks can be used as beasts of burden for the normal versions. An open wagon is a little more than a wooden box on four wooden wheels while an enclosed wagon ensures its riders are unaffected by weather. 

An armored caravan wagon requires two mekillots to pull, has multiple rooms on multiple levels, and can carry a cargo of 15,000 pounds of goods, up to 50 fully armed warriors, 25 slaves in transit, and a handful of merchants, nobles, or other travelers. The defense balconies in an armored caravan wagon provide half cover against any attacks from outside. Anyone riding an enclosed or armored caravan wagon is considered to be at rest and shaded.

## Vehicle Proficiency
If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or silt), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.

## Expenses
When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

#### Lifestyle Expenses 
Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Lifestyle Expenses
| Lifestyle | Price/Day | 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| Wretched                 | ---    | 
| Squalid                 | 5 beads     |
| Poor                 | 2 bits     |
| Modest                 | 1 ct     |
| Comfortable                 | 3 ct     |
| Wealthy                 | 5 ct     |
| Aristocratic                 | 10 ct minimum     |

}}

 {{width:7px}} ***Wretched.*** You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.

\column

 {{width:7px}} ***Squalid.*** You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setbacks. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.

***Poor.*** A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

***Modest.*** A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, priests, artisans, and the like.

***Comfortable.*** Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

***Wealthy.*** Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

***Aristocratic.*** You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

# Goods and Services

## 
 {{width:7px}} In the world of Athas, trade is the greatest power next to the Sorcerer-Kings themselves. Your next meal, your path to the next adventure, your very freedom- all depend on the mighty token. 

<br>

### Selling Treasure 
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

***Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.*** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

***Magic Items.*** Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you wouldn't normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple currency and should always be treated as such.

***Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.*** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

***Trade Goods.*** On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

### Services
Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, an Arcanist might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the *secret stash* spell. A Fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A Rogue might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming gala in a wealthy noble's estate.

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a psurlon den are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, they might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the  compensation.

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

### Spellcasting Services
People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.

Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as *cure wounds* or *identify*, is difficult enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 ceramic tokens (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve entreating a city-state's templarate or noble houses. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.

### Food, Drink, and Lodging
The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual consumable items and a single night’s lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.



***Berril Moss.*** A blue-green moss that often covers the floor of forests. When dried it is edible and tastes like dried tea leaves.

***Betel Nuts.*** A soft-shelled nut with a soft blue interior kernel. Betel nuts release a sweet juice when chewed that stains the teeth blue, but upset the stomach when eaten. 


***Broy.*** Broy is made from fermented kank nectar. When served plain, it is potent and foul tasting. However, broy can be served warm and spiced with a pungent herb that disguises its sourness.

***Farro.*** Farro is a cactus, both the needles and cortex are edible. The cortex is tart and juicy. The needles are bland and tasteless, but nutritious.

***Kank Mead.*** A fermented alcoholic beverage made from kank honey. It is green. Spiced mead has spices added for a range of exotic flavors.

***Kumis.*** A foamy fermented beverage made from sygra milk. It is white and slightly sour.

***Meats.*** The edible flesh of animals. *Aprig* meat is a succulent and nutty white meat. *Baazrag* meat is a mellow tasting lean red meat. *Carru* meat is a savory red meat. *Erdland* and *Erdlu* meat is very similar, they are both lean white meats that easily absorb the flavor of spices. *Inix* meat is dry and gamey. *Jankx* meat is often dried, instead of cooked, and has a strong peppery flavor. *Kip* meat has a soft nutty flavor. *Mekillot* meat is dry, stringy, and barely palatable. *Sygra* meat is a tough red meat that is slightly sweet. *Z'tal meat* is a salty white meat.

***Pulque.*** A thick fermented beverage made from cactus juice. It is milky white and sour tasting.

***Rations.*** All the dried food an adult Medium sized creature needs for a single day. Rations contain some sort of dried meat, vegetable, and bread.

***Renk.*** A 2 to 3 inch slug that varies in color. Renk live in rotting vegetation or on the body of a creature. Renk store moisture in an extra stomach that ruptures when they are eaten raw. If eaten raw, renk provide 1/2 cup of water. Exposure to direct sunlight kills them in 1d4 turns.

***Rock Cactus.*** The rock cactus is a spherical plant that is edible if peeled, having a taste and texture similar to apples. A single plant will yield up to a pound of edible flesh and 4 pints of fluid.

***Teff Grain.*** A cereal grass cultivated for its small grain.

***Water.*** In most cities, water is drawn from a collective cistern maintained by Templars and then distributed or sold. The prices are subject to change during dry periods or when Templars want to extort more money.

***Yucca.*** A tree or shrub grown for its edible seeds, flowers, flowering stems, roots, and fruits.

| Laq | Inhaled | 100 ct |
|Quicksilver|Injury|200 ct|
|  Voda| Injected | 120 ct |


}}

## Drug Descriptions

***Absentia.*** When you drink absentia, you fall into a comatose state and are unconscious for one hour. During this time, you perceive the world through the senses of a random creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher within a radius of one mile from you. The effect is similar to that of the *scrying* spell, but you perceive sensations through all five senses from the point of view of the targeted creature. The elixir cannot target anyone affected by *Hamanu's aegis*, *mind blank*, or a similar effect. Some users of absentia report that it occasionally causes bouts of sleepwalking during the comatose state induced by the substance.

Absentia's origin is unknown, but it possesses a strange hold over those who use it. Repeated use risks shaky hands and a kind of nervous disorder-- when waking from a use of absentia, you must make a DC 5 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. While cursed, you have disadvantage on all Dexterity checks. A *remove curse* or *greater restoration* spell can remove this curse.
:

***Githleaf.*** Often sold as bundles of dried, torn plant matter called "scrap", githleaf is used by tucking a pinch between the gum and cheek. As the githleaf regains moisture, its toxins are quickly absorbed into the blood stream, causing the user to experience intense feelings of relaxation and calmness before falling into a semi-unconscious euphoria. More importantly, however, githleaf slows the user's psionic activity to such a point that they become more resilient against telepathic probes or projections, a quality that has led to a harsh Templar crackdown against the drug. 

Upon use, the user must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated. If they succeed, any psionics targeting them with a saving throw to resist (including spells such as *mind whip*) must reduce their DC by 2 for 1 hour. Once the effect ends, the user must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become addicted. The DC increases by 2 for each use of githleaf within the past 7 days. Once addicted, the user takes 1d6 damage each day unless they use githleaf again. The withdrawals end after 5 days.

:

***Hypnos.*** This is a tasteless, odorless brew of herbs commonly peddled in Bard’s Quarters. It is typically used by bards and mindbenders to “soften up” a target before attempting to manipulate them or manifest a power. The target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer a 1d4 penalty modifier to saving throws against psionic effects for 1 minute.

:

***Laq.*** Laq is a vicious drug of black, syrupy venom, poured into a heated clay or porcelain pot, whose vapors are then inhaled. It induces a psychadelic effect in the user swiftly followed by voracious amounts of energy. Used excessively, it can cause a blackened tongue and a darkening of the eyes' sclera. In heavy doses it brings about raving, uncontrollable battle rage that pushes the user to fight well past the point others would die. 
 
A user of laq at normal doses must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw to remain focused, adding 1d4 to any Charisma or Intelligence-based skill checks for 1 hour on a success, with no benefits beyond the high on a failure. 

Any user who takes two or more doses within an hour begins to froth at the mouth as they are filled with a wild frenzy, gaining an additional action on each turn and no longer suffering the staggered condition if reduced to 0 hit points. They must immediately make a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw, suffering no additional effects on a success and losing the ability to determine friend from foe on a failure. These effects last for 1 minute, after which the user suffers one level of exhaustion and vomits profusely. 

:

***Quicksilver.*** A silvery dust of refined esperweed, created by Monks seeking greater understanding of the Way. The user must make a small incision and mix the dust with their blood until a shiny paste forms, then bind the wound like a poultice. 

Those who use this drug feel their skulls shake with psionic energies, and must roll on the table below to determine the drug's effects. 

{{classTable,frame,decoration

|  3  | Gain 1 Wild Talent of your choice for 1 day |              
|  4  | Your mind buzzes. Gain 1 point of Inspiration |
}}


***Voda.*** A concentrated variant of laq which compels truth when injected. A creature subjected to voda must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a *zone of truth* spell.

## Poison Descriptions

Few markets peddle poisons openly, but such merchants exist in every city-state. Those with skill in crafting may harvest and develop less commonly seen poisons (see Chapter 7).


:

***Basic Poison.*** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute.

:

***Bleached Slumber (ingested).*** Made from mixing sun bleached inix bone and esperweed sap, typically mixed with spiced wine. This poison is typically used as a preliminary attack before ambushing rival noble houses, Templar officials, or Veiled Alliance cells. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned and unable to use psionics or cast arcane spells for 1 minute. Those who fail the saving throw by 5 or more are also unconscious and may be awakened by taking damage or if another creature uses an action to shake them awake. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw to be able to use psionics and cast arcane spells again.

:

***Blight (injury).*** This poison made from undead extract forces the target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 hour. The creature can attempt a saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.  

:

***Cactus venom (injury).*** When correctly harvested and refined, the venom contained in the tiny sac at the base of a hunting cactus' spine can be made into a fast-acting paralytic agent. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is also paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

\column
:::

***Ether vapor (Inhaled).*** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

:

***Id fiend essence (contact).*** A combination of an id fiend's blood and cranial fluid can create a poison that causes terrifying hallucinations on contact.  A creature subject to this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution save or be frightened for 1 minute. The creature can attempt a save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

:

***Malice (Inhaled).*** A creature subject to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 4 (1d8) poison damage and have disadvantage on saves against poison and disease. The creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save. After one successful save, the effect ends.
 
:

***Midnight Tears (Ingested).*** A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, they must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) poison damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

:

***Pale Tincture (Ingested).*** A near-undetectable poison often used to riddle a target with inexplicable sickness for weeks on end. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 1d6 poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.

:

***Purple scorpion venom (injury).*** The poison of the purple scorpion, often found camouflaged in the violet grasses outside Urik, is extremely potent for its tiny size, causing muscle spasms and loss of strength more commonly associated with much larger poisonous creatures. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 17 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

:

***Slayer Sap.*** Harvested from a tree common to the Ringing Mountains, this thick green sap burns like acid. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d12 poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

## Magic Items
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.

### Rarity
Each magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items, such as a *potion of healing*, are the most plentiful. Some legendary items, such as the *apparatus of Kwalish*, are unique. The secrets of creating the most powerful items arose ages ago and were then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and mishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily created. Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities.

Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity table. A character doesn't typically find a rare magic item, for example, until around 5th level. That said, rarity shouldn't get in the way of your campaign's story. If the DM allows a *ring of invisibility* to fall into the hands of a 1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will arise from that event.

Rarity can also help the DM set prices for them. The DM determines the value of an individual magic item based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in the Magic Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable item, such as a potion or scroll, is typically half the value of a permanent item of the same rarity.


{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Magic Item Rarity
| Rarity | Character Level | Value |
|:------------------:|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Common                 | 1st or higher     | 50--100 ct                |
| Uncommon               | 1st or higher     | 101--500 ct                |
| Rare               | 5th or higher     | 501--5,000 ct                |
| Very rare             | 11th or higher     | 5,0001--50,000 ct                |
| Legendary             | 17th or higher     | 50,001+ ct                |
}}

### Cursed Items
Some magic items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. A magic item's description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including the *identify* spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item's user when the curse's effects are revealed.

A cursed item typically cannot be removed, and the effects can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the *remove curse* spell.

### Identifying a Magic Item
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a magic item's appearance, handling the item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about it. Discovering a magic item's properties isn't automatic, however.

The *identify* spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is usually enough to tell the taster what the potion does.

Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it's a *ring of feather falling*.

Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a *ring of jumping*, the DM could say, "Your steps feel strangely springy." Perhaps the character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then find the character jumps unexpectedly high.

### Buying and Selling
Unless you decide your campaign works otherwise, most magic items are so rare that they aren't available for purchase. Common items, such as a *potion of healing*, can be procured from an alchemist, herbalist, or spellcaster. Doing so is rarely as simple as walking into a shop and selecting an item from a shelf. The seller might ask for a service, rather than coin.

In a large city-state, buying and selling magic items might be possible. Even so, it's likely to remain similar to the market for fine art, with invitation-only auctions and a tendency to attract thieves.

Selling magic items is difficult primarily because of the challenge of finding a buyer. Plenty of people might like to have a magic sword, but few of them can afford it. Those who can afford such an item usually have more practical things to spend on. See Chapter 7  for ideas on how to handle selling magic items.

### Magic Item Categories
Each magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, tattoos, wands, weapons, or wondrous items.

#### Armor
Unless an armor's description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to function.

Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as so-ut mail or braxat plate. If a magic armor doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

#### Potions
Different kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce of liquid.

Potions are consumable magic items. Administering a potion to another character requires an action, while drinking a potion may be either an action or bonus action (with some potions, such as a *potion of healing* gaining additional benefits if used as an action). Applying an oil might take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.

#### Rings
Magic rings offer an amazing array of powers to those lucky enough to find them. Unless a ring's description says otherwise, a ring must be worn on a finger, or a similar digit, for the ring's magic to function. 

#### Rods
A scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is typically made of metal, wood, or bone. It's about 2 or 3 feet long, 1 inch thick, and 2 to 5 pounds.

#### Scrolls 
Most scrolls are spells stored in written form, while a few bear unique incantations that produce potent wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.

A scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing that magic requires using an action to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust. 

Any creature that can understand a written language can read the arcane script on a scroll and attempt to activate it.

\column

#### Staffs
A magic staff is about 5 or 6 feet long. Staffs vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds.

Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can be used as a quarterstaff.

#### Tattoo
A magic tattoo is inscribed on the body of a creature, often requiring special inks with exotic ingredients like crystal dust or dragon blood. Magic tattoos cannot overlap each other.

Magic tattoos are consumable magic items, fading from the body of the creature once used. Activating a magic tattoo requires an action to touch it and will it to produce its effect, called “tapping” it. Once used, a tattoo takes effect immediately and then disappears.

A magic tattoo is more dynamic than its mundane counterpart. As an action, the bearer of a magic tattoo can move it to any surface on its body it wishes, or onto another creature in physical contact with it who then becomes its new bearer.

If the bearer of a magic tattoo is unconscious or dead, another creature can touch the tattoo as an action and either activate its effects on the bearer, or transfer the magic tattoo onto their own body.

#### Wands
A magic wand is about 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.

#### Weapons
Whether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are coveted by many adventurers.

Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

#### Wondrous Items 
Wondrous items include worn items such as boots, belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and other objects also fall into this catch-all category.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

### Wearing and Wielding Items
Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand.

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For example, armor made by the Thri-kreen might not fit more humanoid races, or Seedlings may only make items whose effects extend to Small creatures. The ultimate decision on whether an item is worn as intended lies with the DM. 

#### Multiple Items of the Same Kind
Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of head wear, and one cloak. The DM may make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or be able to layer two cloaks.

\column

#### Paired Items
Items that come in pairs-- such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-- impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a *boot of striding and springing* on one foot and a *boot of elvenkind* on the other foot gains no benefit from either item.

### Magic Item Resilience
Most magic items are objects of extraordinary artisanship. Thanks to a combination of careful crafting and magical reinforcement, a magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic items, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance to all damage. Artifacts are practically indestructible, requiring extraordinary measures to destroy.

### Special Features
You can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking about its backstory. Who made the item? Is anything unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and how was it originally used? What minor magical quirks set it apart from other items of its kind? Answering these questions can help turn a generic magic item, such as a *+1 longsword*, into a more flavorful discovery.

### Activating an Item
Activating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules for their activation. 

If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the Rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item.

#### Command Word
A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can't be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the *silence* spell.

#### Consumables 
Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.

\column

#### Spells
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you're a Rogue with the Use Magic Device feature- your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.

#### Charges
Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an *identify* spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature is wielding or wearing the item. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature using it learns how many charges it regained.

## {{font-size:20pt,font-family:MrEavesRemake Ability Scores}}


<div style='margin-top:52px;'></div>



Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics:
- **Strength**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creature's attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in Chapter 8.

### Ability Scores & Modifiers 
Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and supernatural beings can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from --5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.

}}



### Advantage & Disadvantage
Sometimes an ability or spell gives you advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. 

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage or disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the Seedling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a Seedling has advantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the Seedling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration (see Chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character’s personality, ideals, or bonds. The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

### Proficiency Bonus
Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in Chapters 1 and 2. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.
 
Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the Rogue's Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

\column

## Ability Checks
An ability check tests a character’s or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Typical Difficulty Classes
| Task Difficulty         | DC &emsp; &emsp;          |
|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Very easy                 | 5    &emsp; &emsp;          |
| Easy                | 10     &emsp; &emsp;            |
| Medium                 | 15    &emsp; &emsp;             |
| Hard               | 20       &emsp; &emsp;         |
| Very hard                | 25    &emsp; &emsp;           |
| Nearly impossible               | 30   &emsp; &emsp;            |

}}

 {{width:7px}} To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.

### Contests
Sometimes one character’s or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

### Passive Checks
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster. Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:

{{text-align:center
**10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check**
}}

&emsp;

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, they have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in Chapter 7.

\column

### Working Together
Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action (see Chapter 8).

A character can only provide help if the task is one that they could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.


#### Group Checks
When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

# Using Each Ability
Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

## Strength
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

#### Strength Checks
A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

***Athletics.*** Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:
- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

Aside from a racial or class feature, only water Clerics and certain Druids know how to swim. The concept is completely foreign and unknown to any characters and most creatures in Athas.


***Other Strength Checks.*** The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
- Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
- Break free of bonds
- Push through a tunnel that is too small
- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged by it
-  Tip over a statue
- Keep a boulder from rolling

\column

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

#### Lifting and Carrying
Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

***Carrying Capacity.*** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.

***Push, Drag, or Lift.*** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

***Size and Strength.*** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

\page

## Dexterity 
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

#### Dexterity Checks
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

***Acrobatics.*** Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

***Sleight of Hand.*** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.

***Stealth.*** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

***Other Dexterity Checks.*** The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
- Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
- Steer a chariot around a tight turn
- Pick a lock
- Disable a trap
- Securely tie up a prisoner
- Wriggle free of bonds
- Play a stringed instrument
- Craft a small or detailed object

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

#### Armor Class
Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as described in Chapter 5.

#### Initiative
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat, as described in Chapter 8.


{{note
##### Hiding
When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

You can’t hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can’t be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.

***Passive Perception.*** When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, they have a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.

***What Can You See?*** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in Chapter 7.

## Constitution
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

#### Constitution Checks
Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
- Hold your breath
- March or labor for hours without rest
- Go without sleep
- Survive without food or water
- Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

#### Hit Points
Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.


\column

## Intelligence 
Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

#### Intelligence Checks
An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

***Arcana.*** Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, and psionic lore.

***History.*** Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations. 

***Investigation.*** When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***Nature.*** Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

***Religion.*** Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about Sorcerer-Kings and their dogma, rites, symbols, and prayers, as well as the practices used by Clerics and Druids in their veneration of the elements. Lastly, you may be able to draw connections between these ceremonies and their origins in the rituals of ancient cults and their secret descendants that lie hidden throughout Athas still. 

***Other Intelligence Checks.*** The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
- Communicate with a creature without using words
- Estimate the value of a precious item
- Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
- Forge a document
- Recall lore about a craft or trade
- Win a game of skill

#### Psionic Ability
Psions use Intelligence as their psionic ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of psionic powers they use.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Arcanists use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells or powers they cast.

## Wisdom
Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

#### Wisdom Checks
A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

***Animal Handling.*** When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

***Insight.*** Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

A character may make a DC 10 Insight check after listening to a speaker’s dialect for at least 1 minute to determine their city of origin, or is opposed by a Deception check if the speaker is trying hide it.

***Medicine.*** A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

***Perception.*** Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.

For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are bandits lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

##### Finding a Hidden Object
When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.

In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.

 {{width:7px}} ***Survival.*** The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs of a nearby creature, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

***Other Wisdom Checks.*** The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
- Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
- Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

#### Psionic Ability
Empaths use Wisdom as their psionic ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of psionic powers they use.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Clerics, Druids, and Nomads use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

## Charisma
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

#### Charisma Checks
A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

***Deception.*** Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

Casters may use this skill to make their verbal and somatic components resemble those of other classes, opposed by an Insight check. If the person being deceived would have reason to recognise the type of spellcasting, they have advantage on the roll. For example, a group of commoners seeing an Arcanist trying to mask their spellcasting as Cleric spellcasting might not have advantage, but any other Arcanist, a Templar, or an actual Cleric would have advantage on their Insight roll.

***Intimidation.*** When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

***Performance.*** Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

***Persuasion.*** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see a noblewoman, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

\column

::

***Other Charisma Checks.*** The DM might call for a Charisma check when you attempt tasks such as finding the best person to talk to for news and rumors, or blending into a crowd to get the sense of a conversation's key topics.

#### Psionic Ability
Icons use Charisma as their psionic ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of psionic powers they use.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Crusaders and Templars use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
 
## Saving Throws
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The Arcanist, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add their proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save m eans that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

## Skills
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

&emsp;

**Strength**    {{width:97px}} **Wisdom**

Athletics       {{width:99px}} Animal Handling
                 
&emsp;          {{width:140px}}       Insight

**Dexterity**   {{width:95px}} Medicine

Acrobatics      {{width:88px}} Perception

Sleight of Hand  {{width:57px}} Survival

Stealth

&emsp;         {{width:138px}}     **Charisma**

**Intelligence**    {{width:78px}}   Deception

Arcana          {{width:108px}}  Intimidation

History           {{width:106px}} Performance

Investigation    {{width:71px}}  Persuasion

Nature          

Religion


&emsp;





Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they just make a Strength check.

\column

#### Skills with Different Abilities
Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. 

For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check.

So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your Dul Barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.

:

{{note
##### Tools and Skills Together
Tools have more specific applications than skills. For example, the History skill applies to any event in the past, while a tool such as a forgery kit is used to make fake objects and little else. So, when given a choice, you may wonder- why gain a tool proficiency in place of proficiency in a skill? In DARK SUN, tools and skills can work together to provide advantage or additional benefits on applicable checks. 

***Advantage.*** If the use of a tool and the use of a skill both apply to a check, and a character is proficient with the tool and the skill, the character can make the check with advantage. 

***Added Benefit.*** In addition, characters who have both a relevant skill and a relevant tool proficiency can gain an added benefit on a successful check. This benefit might be in the form of more detailed information, or could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful check. For example, a character proficient with mason’s tools makes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to find a secret door in a stone wall. Not only does the character notice the door's presence, but the DM may decide that their tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic success on an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine how to open the door.

# {{font-size:44pt Chapter 7}}
## {{font-size:20pt,font-family:MrEavesRemake Adventuring}}


<div style='margin-top:52px;'></div>



Slipping through the back alleys of Tyr, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles of the Ringing Mountains, rappelling into the sunken ruins of Athas' deserts-- these are the things that DARK SUN adventures are made of. Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.

This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your character might pursue between adventures.

Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book ’s introduction:
1. The DM describes the environment.
2. The players describe what they want to do.
3. The DM narrates the results of their actions.

Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters’ progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The DM’s notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers’ actions determine what happens, so the DM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.

### Time
In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.


\column

::::::::

 {{width:7px}} In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the desert hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.

For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best. Following the road from Balic to Urik, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before an Elvhen ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time described in Chapter 8.

### Movement
Sprinting across a volcanic plain, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope - all sorts of movement play a key role in DARK SUN adventures.

The DM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the jungle and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM can summarize movement between encounters: 

“After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient Dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”

Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.


#### Speed
Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.


{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

#### Travel Pace
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the “Activity While Traveling” section later in this chapter for more information). 

***Forced March.*** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see Chapter 8).

***Mounts and Vehicles.*** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, charitos, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a silt or sandborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see Chapter 5), and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Travel Pace
| Pace  |  Distance Traveled per ... |||Effect|
|      ^| Minute |Hour |Day | ^|
|:-----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|  Fast  | 400 feet  | 4 miles  | 30 miles  | -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores  |
|  Normal  | 300 feet  | 3 miles  | 24 miles  | ---  |
|  Slow  | 200 feet  | 2 miles | 18 miles  | Able to use stealth  |

}}



\column

#### Difficult Terrain
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense jungles, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

### Special Types of Movement
Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

#### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling
While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Jumping
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

***Long Jump.*** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

***High Jump.*** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.

### Activity While Traveling
As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group’s journey.

#### Marching Order
The adventurers should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.

***Fewer Than Three Ranks.*** If a war party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, it’s considered a front rank.

#### Stealth
While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. See the rules for hiding in Chapter 6.

#### Noticing Threats
Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and middle ranks cannot. 

While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a &#160; --5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.

***Encountering Creatures.*** If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.

***Surprising Foes.*** If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See Chapter 8 for more about surprise.

\column

#### Other Activities
Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the DM’s permission.

***Navigate.*** The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.

***Draw a Map.*** The character can draw a map that records the group’s progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

***Track.*** A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. 

***Forage.*** The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. 

The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules for navigation, tracking, and foraging to help determine the difficulty and results of these checks. 

{{note
##### Splitting the Party
Sometimes, it makes sense to split a war party, especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks. The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. A Rogue and a Monk moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their Dwarf Crusader friend behind.

## The Environment
By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

:

### Defiled Ground

Characters standing on defiled ground and using magic that draws upon nature or the elements (such as most Cleric and Druid spells) have disadvantage on spell attack rolls.

### Desecrated Ground
Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a *detect the supernatural* spell cast within range reveals its presence.

Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws.

A *hallow* spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.

### Extreme Heat
When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1  each additional hour. 

Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw.

### Falling
A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.

At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

\column

### Food and Water
Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see Chapter 8). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

#### Food
A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character  suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.


#### Water
A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, they two levels in either case.

### Interacting with Objects
A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the DM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything happens.

For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object, with the DM setting the DC.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

### Quicksand
A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a 10-foot-square area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature enters the area, it sinks ld4 + 1 feet into the quicksand and becomes restrained. At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand can't breathe (see "Suffocating" below).

A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand.

### Silt
All that remains of the seas on Athas is silt, a fine, psionically-charged sand that quickly consumes anything which enters it. Silt can be found throughout Athas, most notably in the Silt Sea (described later in this chapter) but also inland where bodies of water may once have ran in rivers or collected as lakes. 

A creature that enters silt will find themselves swiftly plunging into its depths. When a creature enters silt, they sink 1d4+2 feet, become restrained, and begin to suffocate as the silt surrounds them. At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet until it reaches a layer of packed silt (never occuring higher than half the total depth of the silt) or the bedrock at the bottom. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged, it can attempt to escape by grabbing a solid surface nearby and making a Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk. A creature that is completely submerged in silt cannot breathe, and is not helped by  a silt mask. 

A creature on solid footing can pull another creature within its reach out of silt by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand.

#### Gray Death
Silt travelers must be forewarned of the Gray Death: suffocation from windborne dust while wading or flying above the silt (or even traveling near its borders) on windy days. The lungs and the throat slowly clog with dust, and unprotected characters traveling in these conditions suffer dearly. 

When moderate or stronger wind weather conditions are present near a large body of silt, the area is filled with loose silt which sinks into every crevice and chokes the lungs. Creatures in the area are subjected to suffocation rules, unless using a silt mask or similar device.

\column



### Strong Wind
A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Suffocating
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/87HT7Z2/the-environment.png' style='position:relative; top:380px; left:-370px; height:550px; width:370px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page



### Vision and Light
The most fundamental tasks of adventuring —noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few— rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see Chapter 8).

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.

#### Blindsight
A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.

#### Darkvision
Many creatures in the worlds of DARK SUN, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Truesight
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

# The Silt Sea
One need only see the ruins of the ancient cities that litter its shores to realize that Athas was not always the arid waste it is today. Some people believe the Silt Sea was once filled with water, so much water that one could stand on a shore and not see the other side. The silt itself is a grayish powder, like very fine and dry dust. It runs through the fingers like water, leaving not a trace on ones hands. The slightest trace of moisture causes it to stick and clump; it can cake the eyes, nose, and throat in seconds. Breathing the airborne silt slowly lines the lungs with powder and can choke the life from even a giant.

Like water, silt has a devilish ability to find its way into everything. A traveler walking along the borders of the Sea of Silt on a windy day finds boots, packs, and even pockets filling with gray dust. Most of the time it is merely annoying -- but contamination of a canteen or food supplies is a sore blow to the wayfarer on short rations.

Silt is heavier than air, but far lighter than water. Stories tell of inventors who tried to copy the hulled, wheelless vehicles the ancients used to travel through water. The silt is so light, and of so little substance, that even the most carefully built boat sank through the dust to rest on the bottom.

\column

## Terrain of the Silt Sea
To the untrained eye, the silt is an endless plain of desolation, lifeless and deadly. Yet this is only an illusion, a distortion of the truth. The silt possesses its characteristic formations and moods, just as land-forms anywhere do. The experienced silt traveler faces an ever-changing terrain as diverse as that of the Tablelands or the Ringing Mountains. 

Silt is not found in the boundaries of the Sea alone. Many inland dust sinks and silt basins, as well as the great silt estuaries, are found near the borders of the sea or within a few days march. The dust that fills them is carried across the intervening lands in the course of great storms out on the Sea, and it fills the lower-lying areas. The dust basins surrounding Bodach and the Mud Palace were created in this fashion.

Conversely, the Sea of Silt is not composed exclusively of silt. Rocky islands rise from the dust, dotting the surface of the sea with firm land. Bare patches of stone can be found here and there, places where the silt never accumulates, where the earth is scoured flat by endless winds. In other areas, sharp crags pierce the blanket of dust like spears buried in sand. Lastly, of course, there are countless mud flats scattered across the pearly silt.

## Travel in the Silt Sea
The Sea of Silt is one of the most formidable barriers to travel on the world of Athas. Aside from the difficulty of simple movement across the dust, the weather is extremely hostile. Rare are the days when a traveler can find the Sea still enough to attempt a crossing. Also, the Sea is full of dangerous predators that view anything moving as a possible meal. Even giants hesitate before wading silt they do not know, and many refuse to try a crossing without a companion.

There are few good ways to cross silt. The best way is to not do so at all, or befriend a powerful Arcanist and have them teleport one to their destination. Unfortunately, the few mages capable of this rarely care to be bothered with such a mundane goal. Other methods of travel include wading, flying, magic, and the silt skimmer. Each has its advantages as well as its disadvantages.

### Wading
The simplest method, wading, is available to everyone and is cheap. Unfortunately, it is risky in the extreme, slow, and limited in range.

Any character can wade in silt up to three-quarters of their height in depth, chest-high for Humans. Characters who push this to chin-deep run an excellent chance of stepping into a bottom irregularity and immersing their heads in the dust. Wading through silt is hard work; a character's movement is reduced to 1/3 (round down). 

On windy days, the blowing dust makes breathing nearly impossible if one's head is close to the surface of the silt. Beyond that, it is almost impossible to maintain any bearings. In general, the wind must have a strength of Light or less to allow a wading creature to move. Giants, who are strong and practiced waders, may wade in Moderate wind conditions.

***Deep silt.*** If wading through silt deeper than a character's height, there are several options. First, have someone who is taller carry another. Depending on their Strength score, a Tarek could carry one human-sized person with no problem and possibly several in a basket or similar harness. 

A full-blooded giant could carry at least two Human-sized characters and even six or eight with some preparation. One or two Tareks could be carried instead of human passengers. Friendly giants might be persuaded to carry passengers for free; however, most giants expect compensation for their effort.

Second, find a path formed on a layer of compressed silt. Compressible silt only exists in silt of less than 40-50 feet deep and is never higher than half the depth of the siltFor example, the safe layer of a region of silt 20 deep is never closer to the surface than 10 and could possibly be within a foot of the bottom. The best way to take advantage of this phenomenon is to find a place where people have already formed trails and to stay on them.

\column

::

 {{width:7px}} About 10% of the shallow silt enjoys the right conditions of bottom contour to be compressible, but the only way to find out whether a specific location in the silt supports a walkable layer is to test it. If somebody just jumps into the silt, hoping that a path will form beneath their feet, there is a 1 in 10 chance that the conditions are right. Divide the silt depth by two and roll to randomly determine how far from the bottom the compressible layer actually is.

{{note
##### Cannonball!
Kerith, a very foolish elf, leaps into a region of silt 12 deep. The DM rolls 1 on 1d10, indicating that a layer may form that could save Keriths life. Because the silt is 12 deep, the layer will be no higher than 6 from the bottom and could be as low as 1 above the bottom. A roll of 1d6 yields 4; the layer will form 4 from the bottom, 8 from the surface. Unless Kerith is very tall, he's done for.
}}

 {{width:7px}} Silt compression is a fickle phenomenon, and a village with a path used for generations might discover that their path suddenly does not bear weight anymore. This appears to be affected by the weather and the disturbance of the silt by large storms.

***Stilts.*** The last and least-preferred method requires stilts. A character can use stilts to give them a greater height when wading through silt, making a DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check every 300 ft. to keep their balance. Failing the check causes the character to topple over into the silt. The check grows more difficult the higher the stilt- for every additional foot of stilt past half the character's height (rounded down), they add 1 to the DC. In addition, anyone traveling in such a manner must remain at least 2 ft. above the silt's surface to have adequate breathing room. 

For example, a six foot-tall person walking on three-foot tall stilts can wade in silt up to 7 ft. deep (leaving 2 ft. for breathing room), rolling a DC 14 Dexterity check every 300 ft. Should they need to cross depths of 18 ft., they would require 14 ft. stilts and have to make a DC 25 check every 300 ft., a tremendously difficult task.

Moving on stilts is every bit as tiring and slow as wading. Characters are reduced to 1/3 their normal movement rate. Traveling long distances on stilts, particularly in silt of any great depth, is next to impossible.  





{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

### Flying
Flying involves the use of a trained airborne mount, a glider, or a *fly* spell. This is considered by many to be the best method of traveling through regions of silt; movement is fast, dangerous silt creatures can be avoided, and the silt can be crossed regardless of its depth. Unfortunately, nothing is ever quite as easy as it looks.

***Riding a flying mount.*** The most common airborne mounts are pterrax, dragonnels, rocs, and air elementals. Of these, only air elementals are not instinctively afraid of flying over silt. When an animal is forced out over the silt, the rider must make a DC 15 Animal Handling check. Success means they can continue. Failure means the mount turns and heads back to solid ground.

Eventually, even the strongest flyer needs a place to rest. One of the chief disadvantages in flying a mount on an over-silt journey lies in the difficulty of feeding and watering the beast when it finally lands.

***Gliders.*** An excellent short-range solution, but still perilous. Cliff-gliders drop 20 ft. each round and travel 360 ft. forward. A pilot starting from a 200-foot hilltop could stay in the air for ten rounds and glide for 3,600 ft. Obviously, gliders rarely cross more than two or three miles of silt. 

Some glider pilots, particularly those mad enough to seek the Valley of Dust and Fire, claim they have encountered bizarre drafts of warm wind that actually allow them to climb 20 ft a round, forfeiting their forward progress to regain height. Gliders are rare and are seldom sold by the craftsmen who build them.

***A fly spell.*** Another good short-range option. With a flying speed of 60 ft. and a duration of 10 minutes, the target of such a spell could move 1,200 ft, if dashing, before the spell ends. Conceivably, a spellcaster of great power could repeatedly cast *fly* to cover greater distances, but may soon find their spell slots gone before any safe landing is in sight. In addition, flying characters are advised to keep an eye out for the treacherous beasts of the air, such as rocs and cloud rays. 

\column

### Magic and Psionics
Other magical means include personal levitation, levitation of a platform or raft, or travel spells (or psionic disciplines) that do not actually confer the power of flight. Levitating creatures have two options: drift at the mercy of the wind in the air, or  walk across the surface of the silt. Using levitation to walk across the dust allows the character to move as though in difficult terrain. 

A high-level spellcaster may be able to levitate a raft large enough to hold several people; in this case the platform must be either sailed or poled. Poling a raft only works in silt less than 20 ft. deep. Sailing only works when there is wind present, and under those conditions the Gray Death may prove a greater threat than travel. Poled vessels can only cover one mile every two hours; if supplemented with a sail, the speed doubles. Be mindful of your caster's stamina, however, for this faces many of the same dangers as using the *fly* spell- once the raft's levitation ends, you will swiftly sink.

Use of a *ring of feather falling*, or *ring of silt walking* lets a character walk across the dust as though it was hard-packed sand. Both are relatively safe and reliable.

Some psionic powers help in crossing the silt, as well. *Inertial transference* with the *gravitic field* augment, for example, would replicate the effects of a *fly* spell and operate under the same rules. 

Lastly, there is always room for creative (if risky) endeavors with other spells, such as *mold earth* or *beast shape*, which players might be able to employ in crossing silt. Magical experimentation must always be attempted at your own risk. 

#### Silt Skimmer
Silt skimmers, as described in Chapter 5, are among the safest methods for crossing silt, but they are limited. Silt skimmers can travel six to eight miles a day and can carry a load of two tons. However, they cannot cross silt deeper than 15 ft.

For greater depths, there are also skimmers equipped with obsidian engines that are powered by psionics rather than manual labor. These can travel at any depth, but are far more expensive and rare, and also require a powerful psionicist to operate.

# Social Interaction
Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of DARK SUN adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.

Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a Templar patrol so that they will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a **nonplayer character** (NPC).

In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.

Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.

## Roleplaying
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.

Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.

There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.





\column



### Active Approach to Roleplaying
If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.

When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character’s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted out.

Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:

Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, “I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I'd snap your arm and enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”

### Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying
With this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how they do it.

For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the Elvhen tribes for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious Elvhen minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.
 
Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stops over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.”

In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s attitude and actions.

When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:
- Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.
- Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.
- Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.

Don't worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/1Rgf6VY/Roleplaying-Faces.jpg' style='position:relative; top:585px; left:-760px; height:250px; width:400px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

{{pageNumber,auto}}

### Results of Roleplaying
The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn Dwarf refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain merchant laps up flattery.

When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC’s attitude.

Interactions in DARK SUN are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.

\column

### Ability Checks
In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.

Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if they want the dice to play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM’s discretion.

Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the Cleric with Persuasion should do most of the talking.

# Resting 
Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.

## Short Rest
A short rest is a moment for your war party to catch their breath and regroup before continuing on, lasting at least 15 minutes during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, studying, and tending to wounds. 

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

A character can't benefit from more than two short rests in a 24-hour period.

## Long Rest
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 12 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 4 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity— the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them. For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, they can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits. Additionally, a character cannot benefit from a long rest unless they are taking that rest in a safe haven. 

### Safe Havens
A 'Safe Haven' is a place where you can rest and meet your basic needs without fear of violence or injury. A reputable inn might suffice, but a campsite in treacherous terrain would not. 

\column

### Sleeping in Armor
Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer, but sleeping in medium or heavy armor makes it difficult to recover fully during a long rest.
 
When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of exhaustion, the rest doesn’t reduce your exhaustion level.

:

### Going without a Long Rest
A long rest is never mandatory, but going without sleep does have its consequences. 

Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. It becomes harder to fight off exhaustion if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.

# Between Adventures
Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned treasure.

As your campaign progresses, your characters will not only become more powerful but also more influential and invested in the world. They might be inclined to undertake projects that require more time between adventures, such as building and maintaining a stronghold. As the party gains levels, there may be more downtime between adventures to give characters the time they need to pursue such interests. Whereas days or weeks might pass between low-level adventures, the amount of downtime between higher-level adventures might be measured in months or years.

In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to  describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.

\column


## Downtime Activities
Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during their downtime. Downtime activities are tasks that usually take a workweek (5 days) or longer to perform. The days do not need to be consecutive, but you must spend at least 8 hours of each day on the downtime activity for the day to count. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities can include (but are not limited to) crafting items, making social contacts, pulling off crimes, practicing a profession, or simply enjoying some well-earned rest and relaxation.. A character selects a downtime activity from among those available and pays the cost of that activity in time and money. The DM then follows the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the player of the results and any complications that ensue. 

Consider handling downtime away from the game table. For example, players could pick their downtime activities at the end of a session, and then communicate with the DM about them by email or text, until the next session.

### Carousing
Carousing is a default downtime activity for many characters. Between adventures, who doesn’t want to kick back with a few drinks and a group of friends at a tavern? Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a variety of activities such as partying, binge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps them cope with the perils they face on their adventures. 

***Resources.*** A carousing character spends money as though maintaining a wealthy lifestyle, or 25 ct per workweek.

***Resolution.*** The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the location of the character's carousing and their present circumstances. Part of the fun of carousing is that one never knows who they might meet while out on the town. 

The character makes three checks: Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Persuasion), and Charisma (Performance). If the character has proficiency with a gaming set or instrument, that tool proficiency can replace the relevant skill in one check of the player's choosing. The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; the DM generates a separate DC for each one, and any player replacements must happen before the DCs are announced. Consult the Carousing Events table to see how the character did.

### Constructing Strongholds
A character can spend time between adventures building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies within the domain of a city-state, the character will need a royal charter (a legal document granting permission to oversee the estate in the name of the crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing custody of the land to the character for as long as they remain loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can also be acquired by inheritance or other means.

Royal charters and land grants are usually given by the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A small estate might sell for as little as 100 ct or as much as 1,000 ct. A large estate might cost 5,000 ct or more, if it can be bought at all.

A character could also potentially build their stronghold far away from the claimed lands of the Sorcerer-Kings, but this is not without risk. Distance from trade routes increases the expense of acquiring materials and labor, and there is far more danger for a developing stronghold away from the protection of civilization. If choosing to build a stronghold in the wastelands, increase the cost and time of construction by 1.5. 

Once the estate is secured, a character needs access to building materials and laborers. The Building a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the stronghold (including materials and labor) and the amount of time it takes, provided that the character is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can continue while the character is away, but each day the character is away adds 3 days to the construction time.

 {{width:7px}} ***Garrisons.*** Castles and keeps employ soldiers (use the veteran statistics in the Athasian Bestiary) to defend them. Roadside inns, outposts and forts, palaces, and temples typically rely on less-experienced defenders (use the guard statistics in the Athasian Bestiary). These armed warriors make up the bulk of a property's skilled hirelings. 

#### Maintaining a Property
It's not unusual for adventurers-- especially after 10th level-- to gain possession of a castle, a tavern, or another piece of property. They may buy it with their hard-won loot, take it by force, receive it as a reward, obtain it in a lucky round of cards, or acquire it by other means.

The Maintenance Costs table shows the per-day upkeep cost for any such property. (The cost of a normal residence isn't included here because it falls under lifestyle expenses, as seen in Chapter 5.) Maintenance expenses need to be paid every 30 days. Given that adventurers spend much of their time adventuring, a steward or castellan is assumed to be part of a property's staff, capable of running daily affairs and making payments in the owner's absence. 

***Total Cost per Day.*** The cost includes everything it takes to maintain the property and keep things running smoothly, including the salaries of hirelings. If the property earns money that can offset maintenance costs (by charging fees, collecting tithes or donations, or selling goods), that is taken into account in the table. 

***Skilled and Untrained Hirelings*** As noted in Chapter 5, not all hirelings are equal. A skilled hireling can perform duties beyond those without training, and prove particularly vital for small and/or well-defended properties.

#### Running a Business
Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have nothing to do with delving into dungeons or saving the world. A character might inherit a pottery, or the party might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a reward. If they hold on to the business, they might feel obliged to spend time between adventures maintaining the venture and making sure it runs smoothly.

A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number of days spent on this downtime activity (max 30), then compares the total to the Running a Business table to determine what happens.

If the character is required to pay a cost as a result of rolling on this table but fails to do so, the business begins to fail. For each unpaid debt incurred in this manner, the character takes a - 10 penalty to subsequent rolls made on this table.

### Crafting an Item
A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.

***Resources and Resolution.*** In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item’s selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its ceramic token cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items‘ combined cost is 50 ct or lower. Items that cost more than 50 ct can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. It is up to the DM's discretion to determine how many characters can collaborate on an item. A particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might allow four or more workers.

A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to have the appropriate tool proficiency. The DM makes any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment. The following table provides some examples.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
|Proficiency | Bonus |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Herbalism kit     | Antitoxin, *potion of healing*             |
| Leatherworker's tools     | Leather armor, boots                |
| Smith's tools    | Forged armor, weapons              |
| Weaver's tools    | Cloaks, robes                |
}}

 {{width:7px}} If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.

***Complications.*** Most of the complications involved in creating something, especially a magic item, are linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The complications a character might face as byproducts of the creation process are most interesting when the characters are working on a magic item: there’s a 10 percent chance for every five workweeks spent on crafting an item that a complication occurs. The Crafting Complications table provides examples of what might happen.



\column

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Crafting Complications
| d6 | Complication |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 1     | Rumors swirl that what you’re working on is unstable and a threat to the community.              |
| 2     | Your tools are stolen, forcing you to buy new ones.              |
| 3     | A Royal Defiler shows keen interest in your work and insists on observing you.              |
| 4     | A powerful noble offers a hefty price for your work and is not interested in hearing no for an answer. |
| 5     | A Dwarf clan accuses you of stealing their secret lore to fuel your work.               |
| 6     | A competitor spreads rumors that your work is shoddy and prone to failure.              |
}}

 {{width:7px}} ***Crafting Poisons.*** During downtime between adventures, a character can use the crafting rules above to create basic poison if the character has proficiency with a poisoner's kit. At the DM's discretion, the character can also craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients are available for purchase, and tracking down certain ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure.

A character can instead attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison.
 
 
***Crafting Magic Items.*** Creating a magic item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long—term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.

*Potions of healing* and *spell scrolls* are exceptions to the following rules. For more information, see “Brewing Potions of Healing" and "Scribing a Spell Scroll" on the next page. 

To begin creating a magic item, a character needs the item's formula. A formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.

An item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a tembo to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

 {{width:7px}} The Magic ltem Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Magic Item Ingredients
|Item Rarity | CR Range |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Common     | 1--3            |
| Uncommon     | 4--8                |
| Rare    | 9--12             |
| Very rare    | 13--18               |
| Legendary   | 19+               |
}}

 {{width:7px}}  In addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a ceramic token cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item’s rarity as shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. Halve the listed price and creation time for any consumable items.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost
| Item Rarity | Workweeks* | Cost* |
|:------------------|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Common                 | 1     | 50 ct                |
| Uncommon               | 2     | 200 ct                |
| Rare               | 10     | 2,000 ct                |
| Very rare             | 25     | 20,000 ct                |
| Legendary             | 50     | 100,000 ct                |
 *Halved for consumable items || |
}}


 {{width:7px}} To complete a magic item, a character also needs whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a nonmagical object, or proficiency in the Arcana skill.

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is a magic item of the desired sort.

#### Brewing Potions of Healing 
*Potions of healing* fall into a special category for item crafting. A character proficient with herbalism kits can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are shown on the table below.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Item Rarity | Healing | Time | Cost |
|:------------------|:--------:|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Healing                | 2d4 + 2   | 1 day     | 25 ct                |
| Greater healing        | 4d4 + 4   | 1 workweek     | 100 ct                |
| Superior healing       | 8d4 + 8   | 3 workweeks     | 1,000 ct                |
| Supreme healing        | 10d4 + 20 | 4 workweeks     | 10,000 ct                |
}}

#### Scribing a Spell Scroll
With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll, creating a *spell scroll*.

***Resources.*** Scribing a *spell scroll* takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell the character wants to scribe, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. In addition, the character must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the character’s known spells, in order to scribe a scroll of that spell.

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Spell Scroll Costs
| Spell level | Time | Cost |
|:------------------:|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Cantrip                 | 1 day     | 15 ct                |
| 1st               | 1 day     | 25 ct                |
| 2nd               | 3 days     | 250 ct                |
| 3rd             | 1 workweek     | 500 ct                |
| 4th             | 2 workweeks     | 2,500 ct                |
| 5th             | 4 workweeks     | 5,000 ct                |
| 6th             | 8 workweeks     | 15,000 ct                |
| 7th             | 16 workweeks     | 25,000 ct                |
| 8th             | 32 workweeks     | 50,000 ct                |
| 9th             | 48 workweeks     | 250,000 ct                |
}}

 {{width:7px}} ***Complications.*** Crafting a *spell scroll* is a solitary task, unlikely to attract much attention. The complications that arise are more likely to involve the preparation needed for the activity. Every workweek spent scribing brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Scribe a Scroll Complications table.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Scribe a Scroll Complications

| 2     | A Templar learns of your work and accuses you of unlawful spellcraft and literacy. |
| 3     | A long night of work causes you to fall asleep on fresh ink, ruining the day's progress.             |
| 4     | Due to a strange error in creating the scroll, it is instead a random spell of the same level. |
| 5     | The rare parchment you bought for your scroll has a barely visible map on it.               |
| 6     | A thief attempts to break into your workroom.              |

### Crime
This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra tokens, at the risk of arrest.

***Resources.*** A character must spend one week and at least 25 ct casing potential targets before committing the intended crime.

***Resolution.*** The character must make a series of checks, with the DC for all the checks chosen by the character according to the amount of profit sought from the crime. The chosen DC can be 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30. More daring crimes earn greater rewards, as shown on the Loot Value table.

The character makes three checks: Dexterity (Stealth), Dexterity using thieves’ tools, and the player’s choice of Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or Charisma (Deception).

If none of the checks are successful, the character is caught and jailed. The character must pay a fine equal to the profit the crime would have earned and must spend one week in jail for each 25 ct of the fine. If only one check is successful. the heist fails but the character escapes. If two checks are successful, the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout. If all three checks are successful, the character earns the full value.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Loot Value
| DC | Value |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 10    | 50 ct, robbery of a struggling merchant               |
| 15     | 100 ct, robbery of a local mercenary company                |
| 20    | 200 ct, robbery of a noble or prosperous merchant             |
| 25     | 1,000 ct, robbery of the local Templarate      |
| 30     | 1 uncommon magic item, robbery of a Sorcerer-King |
}}

 {{width:7px}} ***Complications.*** A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table (or create a complication of your own) if the character succeeds on only one check. 

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Crime Complications
| d6 | Complication |

| 3     | Your victim is financially ruined by your crime.              |
| 4     | Someone who knows of your crime has been arrested on an unrelated matter. |
| 5     | Your loot is a single, easily identified item that you can't fence in this region.               |
| 6     | You robbed someone who was under a local crime lord's protection, and who now wants revenge.              |

### Pit Fighting
Pit fighting includes gladiatorial matches, underground fighting rings, and other nonlethal forms of combat in an organized setting. If you want to pursue competitive fighting in a battle-to—the-death situation, the standard combat rules apply to that sort of activity.

***Resources.*** Engaging in this activity requires one workweek of effort from a character.

***Resolution.*** The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the opposition that the character runs into. A big part of the challenge in pit fighting lies in the unknown nature of a character's opponents.

The character makes three checks: Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), and a special Constitution check that has a bonus equal to a roll of the character’s largest Hit Die (this roll doesn't spend that die). If desired, the character can replace one of these skill checks with an attack roll using one of the character’s weapons. The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; the DM generates a separate DC for each one, and any player replacements must happen before the DCs are announced. Consult the Pit Fighting Results table to see how the character did.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Pit Fighting Results
| Result | Value |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 0 successes    | Lose your bouts, earning nothing.              |
| 1 success    | Win 50 ct.                |
| 2 successes      | Win 100 ct.                |
| 3 successes     | Win 200 ct.                 |
}}

 {{width:7px}} ***Complications.*** Characters involved in pit fighting must deal with their opponents, the people who bet on matches, and the matches’ promoters. Every workweek spent pit fighting brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Pit Fighting Complications table.

{{classTable,frame,decoration

### Relaxation
Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don’t want to make use of the downtime system.

***Resources.*** Relaxation requires one week. A character needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity.

***Resolution.*** Characters who maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In addition, at the end of the week, a character can end one effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points, or can restore one ability score that has been reduced to less than its normal value. This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration.

***Complications.*** Relaxation rarely comes with complications. If you want to make life complicated for the characters, introduce an action or an event connected to a rival.


### Religious Service
Characters with a religious bent, whether to the Sorcerer-Kings, the elements, or other practices, might want to spend downtime in service to a temple, either by attending rites or by proselytizing in the community. A temple could be many things- an officially sanctioned hall of worship within a city-state, an underground Druidic gathering place, even something as simple as a lone living tree within a market plaza. A character who undertakes this activity has a chance of winning the favor of others who share their faith and see that temple as a place of worship.

***Resources.*** Performing religious service requires access to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs and ethos align with the character’s. If such a place is available, the activity takes one workweek of time but involves no gold piece expenditure.

***Resolution.*** At the end of the required time, the character chooses to make either an Intelligence (Religion) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check. The total of the check determines the benefits of service, as shown on the Religious Service table.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Religious Service
| Check Total | Result |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 1--10     | No effect. Your efforts fail to make a lasting impression.      |
| 11--20     | You earn one favor.               |
| 21+     | You earn two favors.               |

}}


 {{width:7px}} A favor, in broad terms, is a promise of future assistance from a representative of the temple. It can be expended to ask the temple for help in dealing with a specific problem, for general political or social support, or to reduce the cost of a spell's material components by 50%. A favor could also take the form of a powerful being’s intervention, such as an omen, a vision, or a minor miracle provided at a key moment. This latter sort of favor is expended by the DM, who also determines its nature.

Favors earned need not be expended immediately, but only a certain number can be stored up. A character can have a maximum number of unused favors equal to 1 + the character‘s Charisma modifier (minimum of one unused favor).

***Complications.*** Temples can be labyrinths of political and social scheming. Even the best-intentioned sect can fall prone to rivalries. A character who serves a temple risks becoming embroiled in such struggles. Every workweek spent in religious service brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Religious Service Complications table.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Religious Service Complications
| d6 | Complication |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 1     | You have offended a member of the faithful through your words or actions.        |
| 2     | Blasphemy is still blasphemy, even if you did it by accident.   |
| 3     | A secret sect in the temple offers you membership.               |
| 4     | Another temple tries to recruit you as a spy. |
| 5     | The temple elders implore you to take up a sacred quest.           |
| 6     | You accidentally discover that an important person in the temple worships the enemy of your faith.               |

### Research
Forewarned is forearmed. The research downtime activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, a magic item, or some other particular topic.

***Resources.*** Typically, a character needs access to a library or a sage to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires one workweek of effort and at least 50 ct spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses.

***Resolution.*** The character declares the focus of the research—a specific person, place, or thing. After one workweek, the character makes an Intelligence check with a +1 bonus per 100 ct spent beyond the initial 100 ct, to a maximum of +6. In addition, a character who has access to a particularly well—stocked library or knowledgeable sages gains advantage on this check.

Determine how much lore a character learns using the Research Outcomes table.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Research Outcomes
| Check Total | Outcome |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 1--5     | No effect.             |
| 6--10     | You learn one piece of lore.               |
| 11--20     |You learn two pieces of lore.               |
| 21+     |You learn three pieces of lore.                |
}}

 {{width:7px}} Each piece of lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature's resistances, the password needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells commonly prepared by a local Templar bureau, and so on.

As DM, you are the final arbiter concerning exactly what a character learns. For a monster or an NPC, you can reveal elements of statistics or personality. For a location, you can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place.

***Complications.*** The greatest risk in research is uncovering false information. Not all lore is accurate or truthful, and a rival with a scholarly bent might try to lead the character astray, especially if the object of the research is known to the rival. The rival might plant false information, bribe sages to give bad advice, or steal key tomes needed to find the truth.

In addition, a character might run into other complications during research. Every workweek spent in research brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Research Complications table.

| 6     | You uncovered useful lore, but only by promising to complete a dangerous task in return.              |
}}


### Socializing
***Resources.*** Socializing requires funds for time spent acquiring invitations, plying others with food and drink, and other expenses. A character can attempt to socialize among lower, middle, or upper-class folk. A character can socialize with the lower class for 10 ct per workweek, or 50 ct for the middle class. Socializing with the upper class requires 250 ct per workweek and access to the local nobility.

A character with the Courtier or Noble backgrounds can freely mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if the DM judges that the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit and the Deception skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city-state.

***Resolution.*** After a workweek of socializing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class. The character makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check using the Socializing table.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Socializing
| Check Total | Result |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 1--5     | Character has made a hostile contact.               |
| 6--10     | Character has made no new contacts.                |
| 11--15     | Character has made an allied contact.               |
| 16--20     | Character has made two allied contacts.                |
| 21+     | Character has made three allied contacts.                |
}}

 {{width:7px}} Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.





{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

 {{width:7px}} Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, slaves, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.

Middle-class contacts include guild members, merchants, minor Templar officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.

Upper-class contacts are nobles, higher echelons of a Sorcerer-King's bureaucracy, and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.

Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to socialize with them again to get back into the NPC’s good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn’t come with a guarantee of help.

The DM can assign specific NPCs as contacts. They might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character’s allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the party cares about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn’t come into play.

\column

 {{width:7px}} Alternatively, the DM can allow players to make an NPC into a contact on the spot after socializing. When the characters are in the area in which they spent time socializing, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character socialized. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.

Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives the added depth of specific contacts while also allowing the freedom to ensure that the contacts you accumulate are useful. 

The same process can apply to hostile contacts. The DM can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or they might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.

At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character’s Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don't count toward this limit—only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.

***Complications.*** Characters who socialize risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation. As a rule of thumb, a character has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each workweek of socializing.

### Training
A character can gain undergo training to gain proficiency with a new kind of tool, learn a language, or even train with new kinds of armor and weapons. In order to learn such skills, you must find an instructor willing to teach you.  At the DM’s discretion, members of your war party may be able to train each other.

***Armor.*** Before undergoing armor training, a character must first meet certain prerequisites, as shown on the table below. Once trained, they gain proficiency with all armor of that category. 

***Shields and Weapons.*** Proficiencies gained with shields or weapons apply only to the specific shield or weapon a character is training with.  A character training with a macahuitl, for example, would not become proficient with all martial weapons. 

***Resources.*** Training requires a number of workweeks based on what is being learned, as shown on the table below. This time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier, to a minimum of one workweek. Training costs 25 ct per workweek.

{{classTable,frame,decoration

|Training            | Prerequisites | Weeks |  Cost |
|:-------------------|:---------:|:---------:|:------------: |
| *Armor*               | | 24        | 600 ct
| &emsp;Light              | None |
| &emsp;Medium | Light armor proficiency | | |
| &emsp;Heavy              | Medium armor proficiency | | |
|*Language*            | |         | |
|  &emsp;Standard       | | 10         | 250 ct
|  &emsp;Exotic      | | 16         | 400 ct 
|Tool      | | 10       | 250 ct
| *Weapons* | | | |
|  &emsp;Simple       | | 6         | 150 ct
|  &emsp;Martial      | | 10         | 250 ct
|  &emsp;Exotic      | | 10         | 250 ct
}}

***Complications.***  Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, usually involving your teacher.

### Work
When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character's attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

***Resources.*** Performing a job requires one workweek of effort.

***Resolution.*** To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), Intelligence using a set of tools, Charisma (Performance), or Charisma using a musical instrument. Consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Wages
| Check Total | Earnings |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 9 or lower    | Poor lifestyle for the week.              |
| 10--14     | Modest lifestyle for the week.                |
| 15--20     | Comfortable lifestyle for the week.               |
| 21+     | Comfortable lifestyle for the week + 25 ct.                |
}}

***Complications.*** Ordinary work is rarely filled with significant complications. Still, the Work Complications table can add some difficulties to a worker’s life. Each workweek of activity brings a 10 percent chance that a character encounters a complication.

{{classTable,frame,decoration

{{chapter}}

# {{font-size:44pt Chapter 8}}
## {{font-size:24pt,font-family:MrEavesRemake Combat}}


<div style='margin-top:52px;'></div>


The clatter of a sword striking against a shield. The terrible rending sound as
monstrous claws tear through armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame blossoms from an Arcanist’s spell. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters. Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in DARK SUN can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.

This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish, an extended conflict in a dungeon, or a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master.

The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. “You” can also mean the character or monster that you control.

### The Order of Combat
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A **round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

{{note
##### Combat Step-by-Step

 {{width:7px}} **1. Determine surprise.** The DM determines whether anyone in the combat encounter is surprised.

**2. Establish positions.** The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are— how far away and in what direction.

**3. Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.

**4. Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.

**5. Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.
}}


<br><br><br><br><br><br>


#### Surprise
A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A sand cactus lurks beneath the desert, waiting for someone to fall through and impale themselves upon its spines. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.


#### Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.





{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

### Your Turn
On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet. 

The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action. The “Movement and Position” section on the next page gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”

#### Bonus Actions
Various class features, psionic powers, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

#### Other Activity on Your Turn
Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

\column

### Reactions
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

{{note
##### Interacting with Objects Around You
Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:
- draw or sheathe a sword
- open or close a door
- withdraw a potion from your backpack
- pick up a dropped axe
- take a bauble from a table
- remove a ring from your finger
- stuff some food into your mouth
- plant a banner in the ground
- fish a few coins from your belt pouch
- drink all the ale in a flagon
- throw a lever or a switch
- pull a torch from a sconce
- take a book from a shelf you can reach
- extinguish a small flame
- don a mask
- pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
- put your ear to a door
- kick a small stone
- turn a key in a lock
- tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
- hand an item to another character

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Movement and Position
In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

The “Special Types of Movement’’ section in Chapter 7 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.

### Breaking Up Your Move
You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

#### Moving between Attacks 
If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a Fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again. Doing so may require caution, however, as it could invoke opportunity attacks, discussed later in this chapter. 


#### Using Different Speeds
If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because an Arcanist cast the *fly* spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

\column

### Difficult Terrain
Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

### Being Prone
Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. Such combatants are considered prone (see "Conditions" later in this chapter).

You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.

### Moving Around Other Creatures
You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space freely. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only under the following conditions: 
- If the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. (Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.)
- If using the overrun or tumble actions, detailed under the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. 

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.

### Flying Movement
Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the *fly* spell.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

### Creature Size
Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Size Categories
| Size        | Space          |
|:------------------:|:-----------------|
| Tiny                | 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.          |
| Small                | 5 by 5 ft.           |
| Medium                 | 5 by 5 ft.           |
| Large               | 10 by 10 ft.        |
| Huge               | 15 by 15 ft.           |
| Gargantuan              | 20 by 20 ft. or larger           |

}}

#### Space
A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium Tarek stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the Tarek lets them.

A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.

\column

{{note
##### Playing on a Grid
If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.

***Squares.*** Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.

***Speed.*** Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.

If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.

***Entering a Square.*** To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in.

If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.

***Corners.*** Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.

***Ranges.*** To determine the range on a grid between two things— whether creatures or objects— start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.

## Actions in Combat
When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

### Attack 
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the Fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

### Cast a Spell
Spellcasters such as Arcanists and Clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses their action in combat to cast such a spell. See Chapter 9 for the rules on spellcasting.

### Dash
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

### Disarm 
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

\column

::

### Disengage
If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

### Dodge
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (see "Conditions") or if your speed drops to 0.

### Help
You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

### Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in Chapter 6 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter.

{{note
##### Improvising an Action
Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your character’s ability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in Chapter 6 for inspiration as you improvise.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

### Manifest Psionics
Psionicists such as Empaths, Icons, and Psions, as well as many monsters, have access to psionics and can use them to great effect in combat. Each psionic talent or augment has a casting time, which specifies whether the psionicist must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to manifest. Manifesting a talent or augment is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most psionics do have a casting time of 1 action, so a psionicist often uses their action in combat to manifest their psionics. See Chapter 11 for the rules on using psionics.

### Overrun
When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

### Ready
Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can act later in the round using your reaction.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a spell or psionic power, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell or psionic power must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell or power requires concentration (explained in Chapter 9). If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the *web* spell and ready *magic missile*, your *web spell* ends, and if you take damage before you release *magic missile* with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

\column

### Search
When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

### Tumble
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

### Use an Object
You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

## Making an Attack
Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a psionic power or spell, an attack has a simple structure.

**1. Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.

**2. Determine modifiers.** The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, psionic powers, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.

**3. Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll and roll damage on a hit, unless the  attack has rules that say otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there’s ever any question if what you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.

### Attack Rolls
When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.


#### Modifiers to the Roll
When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

***Ability Modifier.*** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some spells and psionic powers also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell or psionic attack depends on the spellcasting or psionic ability of the spellcaster/psionicist, as explained in Chapters 9 and 11 respectively.

***Proficiency Bonus.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a psionic power or spell.

#### Rolling 1 or 20
Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. In addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.

\column

### Unseen Attackers and Targets
Combatants can try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting *invisibility*, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.

When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.

If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

### Ranged Attacks
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many psionic powers and spells also involve making a ranged attack.

#### Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack has a single range, such as some psionic powers or spells, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.

### Melee Attacks
Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

When you are **unarmed**, you can fight in melee by making an unarmed strike, as shown in the weapon table in Chapter 5.




{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

#### Cleave
When a melee attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points.

#### Flanking 
When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy they can see and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they are flanking that enemy. While a creature is incapacitated, prone, restrained, or flanked, it is incapable of flanking. A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking.

Creatures who are flanking gain a +2 to attack rolls against the flanked creature. 

If against a medium or smaller creature, and a third ally stands on a open space next to the creature, the attack roll bonus becomes +5. For Large or larger creatures, 4 medium or smaller creatures are needed to surround it to obtain the +5 bonus.

At the DM's discretion, creatures that are not disadvantaged by multiple opponents due to their type (like Oozes) are immune to being flanked.

#### Grappling
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

***Escaping a Grapple.*** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.

***Moving a Grappled Creature.*** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.



\column

#### Opportunity Attacks
In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature’s movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

#### Shoving a Creature
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)  check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you take the Attack action and attack with a melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of an attack with your off-hand, unless that modifier is negative. 

If you can make more than one attack using the attack action, such as with the Extra Attack class feature, you can use either hand to make the attack as long as both weapons are used by the end of the attack action.

To benefit from Two-Weapon Fighting, you must either be wielding two Light melee weapons, or be wielding one one-handed melee weapon in one hand and a one-handed melee weapon that normally deals 1d4 or less damage (such as a dagger, light hammer, etc.) in the other.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

## Special Circumstances

### Mounted Combat
A beast rider charging into battle on an inix, an Arcanist casting spells from the saddle of a mekillot they're magically controlling, or a Cleric travelling through the sands on a hardy carru all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

#### Mounting and Dismounting
Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a crodlu. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet of it.

#### Controlling a Mount
While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures act independently.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated kank, crodlu, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount merges with yours when you mount it. You both occupy the same space, determined by the size of your mount, until you dismount. Your speed becomes zero until you dismount, but you may use any speed available to your mount as though it were yours. When you move this way, you and your mount move together, occupying the same space. 

On each of your turns, you gain access to a special additional action which you may only use to dash or disengage (when disengaging with this action, neither you nor your mount provoke opportunity attacks). Any enemy targeting an attack or single-target effect at the space you both occupy decides which of you to affect.

Intelligent mounts which are not mounted and controlled act according to their own desires and interests, as determined by the DM. 

\column


<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>


### Silt Combat
The choking environs of the silt seas and dust basins are generally a bad place to pick a fight. In many cases, the slightest misstep could send a character into the silt. Few creatures who fall in this way are ever seen again. If a PC is forced to make a stand, they should find the nearest solid ground and put it beneath them before engaging in melee with attackers.

**Wading** characters are reduced to 1/3 movement (rounded down) and make initiative rolls with disadvantage. Under-silt creatures such as silt horrors are able to attack wading characters with advantage. A character knocked unconscious will fall beneath the silt and begin suffocating without the benefit of gaining the gulp of air required to hold their breath. 

Characters on stilts make initiative rolls with disadvantage and lose all Dexterity modifiers to their Armor Class. Each successful hit against them requires a stilt-walking Dexterity check (see Chapter 7) in order to remain on the stilts. A character who is knocked off the stilts begins to suffocate as they enter the silt.

**Walking** characters (including those using magical or psionic devices) fight normally, but still might not see under-silt attackers. A walking character who must concentrate to maintain this ability will sink if knocked unconscious.

**Flying** characters follow the normal rules of mounted combat, and characters on silt skimmers do not gain any special benefits or suffer any challenges other than the constant effects of a silt environment, such as the Gray Death. 

### Underwater Combat
While extremely rare  in the world of DARK SUN, there may come a time where your character fights underwater, such as within a flooded ruin or while adventuring in the lost city of Saragar. In such situations, the following rules apply.

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is one your DM discerns as an exception, examples of which include daggers, forearm axes, javelins, shortswords, spears, tortoise blades, or tridents. 

A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart). Other weapons such as bows or dejada must fight the resistance of water and always roll with disadvantage. 

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.



{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Cover
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

\column

::

 {{width:7px}} A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some psionic powers or spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/M8BhftN/cover.png' style='position:relative; top:105px; left:-225px; height:710px; width:600px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Conditions
Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a psionic power, a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. 

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

#### Blinded
- A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.

#### Charmed
- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

#### Deafened
- A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

#### Frightened
- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
- The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

#### Grappled
- A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the *thunderwave* spell.

\column

::

#### Incapacitated
- An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

#### Invisible
- An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of psionics, magic, or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
- Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.

#### Paralyzed
- A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

#### Petrified
- A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
- The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- The creature has resistance to all damage.
- The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

#### Poisoned
- A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

#### Prone
- A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

#### Restrained
- A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
- The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- The creature is unable to cast any spells or manifest powers with a somatic component. 

#### Stunned
- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

#### Unconscious
- An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
- The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.



{{note
##### Exhaustion
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.


| Level        | Space          |
|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| 1                | Disadvantage on ability checks          |
| 2                | Speed halved          |
| 3                 | Disadvantage on attacks and saving throws           |
| 4               | Hit point maximum halved       |
| 5               | Speed reduced to 0           |
| 6              | Death         |


If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

## Vitality

This ruleset replaces Death Saves from traditional Fifth Edition DUNGEONS & DRAGONS with Vitality, which represents the actual and mortal physical damage a character can sustain before dying. Unlike hit points, Vitality is fixed at 1st level. 

***Starting Vitality.*** A character has Vitality equal to their 1st level Hit Points. This number never changes unless their Constitution modifier changes. 

***Reaching 0 Hit Points.*** When a character's Hit Points are gone, their player chooses to either become *staggered* and gain 1 Death Point, or fall *unconscious*. Any further damage is dealt to that character's Vitality. 

***Death.*** A character with 0 Vitality dies. . 

{{note
##### Glory in Death
If a player chooses to take a 3rd Death Point, resulting in the death of their character, that player may (subject to DM approval) declare a final heroic action that can give advantage or disadvantage to the next roll an ally or foe makes.
}}

  

#### Staggered
Under the *staggered* condition, you have 0 hit points, and you gain 1 Death Point. You no longer have movement. All d20 rolls you make are with disadvantage, and all foes have advantage against your class abilities, such as spells, but not items such as wands. You lose this condition if you gain any hit points. 

{{note
##### Staggered in Play
Although you have no movement when *staggered*, you can use the Dash action to move. You cannot Dodge, as this requires movement, nor Disengage, which modifies your movement. 

In a heated battle, Death Points can quickly accumulate, and these rules eliminate the "whack a mole" effect on combat. 
}}

#### Unconscious
Take 1 Vitality damage and make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to stabilize. On failure, immediately take 1 more point of Vitality damage. If you roll a natural 1, the extra vitality damage is 1d4 instead of 1. At the start of each following turn, take 1 Vitality damage until stabilized. 

Stabilizing an unconscious creature requires you to spend an action to attempt a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. A **stable** creature doesn’t continue taking Vitality damage, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making stabilization saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

#### Death Points
Once a character reaches 2 Death Points, they gain a lingering injury per the Lingering Injuries table. 

Once a character reaches 3 Death Points, they die.

##### Lingering Injuries
| d20&emsp;        | Injury          |
|:------------------:|:-----------------|
| 1               | **Lose an Eye.** You have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you're blinded.         |
| 2                | **Lose an Arm or a Hand.** You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage.           |
| 3                 | **Lose a Foot or Leg.** Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage.          |
| 4               | **Limp.** Your speed is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp.        |
| 5-7               | **Internal Injury.** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting.           |
| 8-10              | **Broken Ribs.** This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10.          |
| 11-13              | **Horrible Scar.** You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher removes the scar.          |
| 14-16              | **Festering Wound.** Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 for every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals.           |
| 17-20              | **Minor Scar.** The scar doesn't have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher removes the scar.         |

## Damage and Healing
Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore the world of Athas. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a *fireball* spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

### Hit Points
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s abilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

### Damage Rolls
Each weapon, psionic power, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.


When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier — the same modifier used for the attack roll — to the damage. A **psionic power or spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a psionic power, spell, or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when an Arcanist casts *fireball* or a Cleric casts *flame strike*, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

#### Critical Hits
When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

\column

#### Damage Types
Different attacks, damaging psionic powers and spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a DM assign a damage type to a new effect.

***Acid.*** The corrosive spray of a braxat’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by some Athasian plants deal acid damage.

***Bludgeoning.*** Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

***Cold.*** The infernal chill radiating from a water elemental myrmidon’s trident and the frigid blast of a frost salamander’s breath deal cold damage.

***Fire.*** Fire elementals strikes easily set foes aflame, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

***Force.*** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including *magic missile* and *spiritual weapon*.

***Lightning.*** A *lightning bolt* spell and an air elemental's lightning strike deal lightning damage.

***Necrotic.*** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as *chill touch*, withers matter and even the soul.

***Piercing.*** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.

***Poison.*** Venomous stings such as from a cistern fiend's tentacles and toxic gas deal poison damage.

***Psychic.*** Mental abilities such as a belgoi’s ego whip deal psychic damage.

***Radiant.*** Radiant damage, dealt by a Cleric’s *flame strike* spell or a Crusader’s Sorcerous Smite, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

***Slashing.*** Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.

***Thunder.*** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the *thunderwave* spell, deals thunder damage.

{{note
##### Describing the Effects of Damage
Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.

### Healing
Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through rare and powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (as explained in Chapter 7), and magical methods such as a *cure wounds* spell or a *potion of healing* can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a Druid grants a Nomad 8 hit points of healing. If the Nomad has 14 current hit points and a maximum of 20, the Nomad regains 6 hit points from the Druid, not 8.

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until restored to life through a spell such as *revivify*.

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When you drop to 0 hit points, you either fall unconscious or take on the staggered condition and 1 Death Point, as explained in the Vitality section. Excess damage from the first attack or effect which causes a character to reach 0 hit points is ignored unless it would outright kill the character.

#### Instant Death
Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your Vitality maximum.

For example, a Cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points and 12 Vitality. If they take 18 damage from an attack, they are reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals their Vitality maximum, the Cleric dies.

#### Stabilizing a Creature
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by continuing Vitality damage. 

#### Monsters and Death
Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than gaining Death Points.

Mighty villains and special NPCs are common exceptions; the DM might have them follow the same rules as player characters.

### Knocking a Creature Out
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable. If an attacker opts to knock a character unconscious, they cannot choose to become staggered.

\column

### Regaining Vitality
At the end of a long rest, characters regain Vitality equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1). 

#### Magical Healing
Magical healing, such as a *cure wounds* spell or healing potion, can restore Vitality only when a character's Hit Points are at their maximum. 

Once a character's Hit Points are full, every 10 points of magical healing effects, calculated at their maximum healing, heals 1 point of Vitality damage. 

For example, a healing potion heals 2d4+2 hit points, for a maximum of 10. Thus, one dose to a character with full hit points would heal 1 point of Vitality damage. A 1st level *healing word* spell on the other hand, which heals 1d4+4 hit points, would have no effect because its maximum healing only amounts to 8 hit points. 

#### Regeneration
*Regeneration* is always counted as a full 10. Hence, a *ring of regeneration*, which restores 1d6 hit points, is counted as 10 so that every minute the ring is worn would heal 1 point of Vitality damage to a character already at full Hit Points. 

#### Healing a Staggered Character
Because a *staggered* character's hit points are not at maximum, healing them does not restore Vitality. Rather, Hit Points would be restored, removing the *staggered* condition.

### Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.

Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. 

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.

### Damage Resistance & Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. 

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

<div style='margin-top:52px;'></div>

For better or worse, magic permeates Athas, and most often appears in the form of a spell. This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.

### What is a Spell?
A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the planet into a specific, limited expression. To cast a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them into a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see Chapter 8), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.

Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the Athas’ history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of the Sorcerer Kings. Or they might be reinvented by characters who have amassed enough power  to do so.

### Spell Level
Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) *magic missile* at 1st level and the earth-shaking *wish* at 9th. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.

#### Cantrips
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.

{{note
##### Casting in Armor
Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.
}}


### Spell Slots
Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, they can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the Templar) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, Umara, a 3rd-level Arcanist, has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.

When a character casts a spell, they expend a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts *magic missile*, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots (see Chapter 7 for the rules on resting).

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. 

#### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts *magic missile* using one of her 2nd-level slots, that *magic missile* is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as *magic missile* and *cure wounds*, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.

### Known and Prepared Spells
Before a spellcaster can use a spell, they must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as Arcanists and Clerics, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.

In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.

{{note
##### Altered Spell Flavor
For flavor only, any spell that purports to have a metallic effect (e.g. *blade barrier*) thematically can have it replaced with obsidian, bone, etc. Similarly, spells that require a watery component (e.g. *Simulacrum* snow) are replaced with an Athas equivalent (e.g. sand or silt).
}}
:

### Rituals
Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.  It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.

To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The Cleric and the Druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on their list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the Arcanist’s does.

::

{{note
##### Magic and Psionics

Any spell that detects or cancels magic also affects psionics, including but not limited to:  *dispel magic, counterspell,* and *anti-magic shell.* Features such as *Magic Resistance* still only affect magic. If a creature is resistant to psionics, for example, it will be listed as *Psionic Resistance.*

}}





\column


### Perceiving a Spell
Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, walls of ice, teleportation, and the like. Other spells, such as *charm person*, display no visible, audible, or otherwise perceptible sign of their effects, and easily go unnoticed by those unaffected by them. As detailed later in this chapter, you normally don’t know that a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a noticeable effect.

But what about the act of spellcasting? Is it possible for someone to perceive that a spell is being cast in their presence? To be perceptible, the spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or material component. The form of a material component doesn’t matter for these purposes, whether it’s an object specified in the spell’s description, a component pouch, or a spellcasting focus.

If the need for a spell’s components has been removed by a special ability, such as the Subtle Spell defiling effect or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the spell is imperceptible. If an imperceptible casting produces a perceptible effect, it’s normally impossible to determine who cast the spell in the absence of other evidence.

#### Disguising the Arcane
Many spellcasters might wish to pass their magic off as another kind-- arcanists might prefer to be seen as a cleric or psionicist, for example. A character attempting to disguise their spellcasting as another kind must make a Charisma (Deception) check opposed by a Wisdom (Insight) check from the target they're attempting to deceive. 


### Identifying a Spell
Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or has already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it’s being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell after it is cast.

If the character perceived the casting, the spell’s effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell’s level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a Cleric, another Cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when  cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.

This Intelligence (Arcana) Check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn’t by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others when they cast their spells.

## Casting a Spell
When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.

Each spell description in Chapter 10 begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

### Casting Time
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

#### Bonus Action
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

#### Reactions
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.

#### Longer Casting Times
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.

### Range 
The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like *magic missile*, the target is a creature. For a spell like *fireball*, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the *shield* spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect” later in this chapter).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.

\column



### Components
A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.

#### Verbal (V)
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the *silence* spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.

#### Somatic (S)
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful wave or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have at least one hand free to perform these gestures.

#### Material (M)
Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in Chapter 5) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before they can cast the spell. If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. 

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that they use to perform somatic components.

 {{note
##### Scarcity and Invention
The ecosystem of Athas has forced casters to find substitute materials for their spells. When appropriate, this book, the DM, or the players may describe a replacement component for flavor. 
}}

### Personalizing Spells
Just as every performer lends their art a personal flair and every warrior asserts their fighting styles through the lens of their own training, so too can a spellcaster use magic to express their individuality.

Regardless of what type of spellcaster you're playing, you can customize the cosmetic effects of your spells. Perhaps you wish your spells to appear in a certain color, or reflect the training of a mentor. The possibilities to customize your character's spells are endless. However, such alterations can't change the effects of a spell. They also can't make one spell seem like another--you can't, for example, make a *magic missile* look like a *fireball*.

### Duration
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

#### Instantaneous
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

#### Concentration
Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:
* **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
* **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a sword blow, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.
* **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a sandstorm choking you while you're in a sand skiff speeding along the dunes, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.

\column

{{note
##### The Schools of Magic
In the past, arcane teachings grouped spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Today, spellcasters apply these categories to all spells, operating off a shared understanding of magic however they come by it. 

The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.

**Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to hidden realms.

**Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjunctions create objects or effects out of nothing.

**Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.

**Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.

**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.

**Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.

**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.

Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as *animate dead* is a forbidden and nearly lost art, not looked on kindly by most within Athas. 

**Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

### Targets
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described in "Areas of Effect").

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

#### A Clear Path to the Target
To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction (the side closest to you).

#### Targeting Yourself
If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.

### Saving Throws
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

### Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated (see Chapter 8).

### Combining Magical Effects
The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two Clerics cast *bless* on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; they don’t get to roll two bonus dice.

### Areas of Effect
Spells such as *burning hands* and *cone of cold* cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these  lines, an obstruction must provide total cover, as explained in Chapter 8.

#### Cone
A cone extends in a direction you choose from its origin. A cone's width at any point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cube 
You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cylinder
A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.

#### Line
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Sphere
You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

# Defilement and Preservation

Athas is a wasteland because spells are powered by living matter -- plants, people, the magic cares not -- and centuries of wars involving the Sorcerer-Kings, the Dragon, and constant defiling has leeched the world dry. 

Spellcasters who defile can draw great power from plant life but in return will permanently reduce every tree, shrub, and even underground root in the area to ash that can never again support life. This leaves a taint on the defiler that can be sensed by those attuned to such things, such as Druids.

While Sorcerer-Kings maintain gardens to pretend at preservation and hunt other defilers ruthlessly, most still keep some as servants to be used when they deem necessary. The harsh truth is that power requires sacrifice, to gain and to hold. No Sorcerer-King could have gained their power without defiling the world, and none could hold onto their kingdoms without the very same spells that strip the soil beneath them.

## The Path of Preservation

When a spellcaster invokes a spell, they draw upon the life energy of Athas. This is unavoidable- even the most powerful Clerics and Druids must pull that power from elsewhere. Most casters are trained to take only what is needed, voluntarily limiting themselves to walk the thin path between power and destruction. Such spellcasters are called Preservers, those who have devoted themselves to preserving what is left of Athas even at the cost of greater power. They often face the same persecution a defiler would, for many do not know enough of magic to tell the difference, but in truth they could not be more at odds.

To most preservers, and especially the Cleric or Druid, there is no greater affront than seeing the precious life of Athas turn to ash, justified for a brief need. And yet- the world of Athas is harsh, and will often demand the sacrifice of such ideals if one wishes to survive. The defiler's choice becomes much harder when looking death in the eye, knowing vast power always lies within reach. 

The temptation will always be there, to defile “just this once,” to ransack Athas' scarce resources once more "for the greater good." For the true preserver, no middle ground can be afforded those who betray the world so. Once a defiler, always a defiler, and better to die than cross that line. 

Player characters with the ability to cast spells are assumed to begin play as preservers, but the option to defile is always present. 

\column


## The Act of Defiling

Every spellcaster casting under the tenets of preservation is aware they are limiting themselves by voluntarily limiting their casting. With any spell, they can cost off their self-imposed restrictions in exchange for a rush of power. In doing so, they mark themselves as a defiler - an enemy of the land, following the legacies of the Sorcerer-Kings by further ravaging Athas. Doing so is an evil act, but many a good-hearted caster has reconsidered their principles when facing impending doom. 

Those who defile can apply a metamagic effect to their non-cantrip spells. Once the spell is cast, every bit of nonsentient plant life in the immediate vicinity is turned to ash, and the land is rendered sterile, unable to sustain life for possibly decades or centuries after. For one year, no matter what is done, the defiled area can never be viable. Even afterwards, all the lifegiving nutrients have been leeched from the soil, requiring skilled intervention before even one blade of grass can grow and taking up to centuries to naturally restore.

A caster who defiles even once will track two new scores: their current defilement points score, a measure of the power they have leeched from the land to power one or more metamagic effects, and their defiler aura, a measure of the total defilement points the character has ever accumulated. 

The following rules describe the powerful effects that can be gained from defilement-- as well as the costs, not only to the defiled land, but also to the defiler themselves. 

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/BNcH58J/defilement.jpg' style='position:relative; top:465px; left:-330px; height:490px; width:250px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

{{pageNumber,auto}}

## The Cost

In order to gain the power necessary for a defiler effect, the spellcaster must leech energy from the terrain around them. The more powerful the magic being cast,  the more life must be torn from the land. Therefore, a spellcaster who wishes to apply a defiler effect to a non-cantrip spell must defile an area of land with a Base Radius equal to **5 times the spell's level**, as shown in the Defilement Radius table below.

Once the spellcaster has defiled a sufficient amount of land, they are able to apply a single defiler effect of their choice to the spell being cast, and immediately add the Point Cost of that effect to their Defiler Aura. Should they wish to apply multiple metamagic effects, the Base Radius of the defiling will increase by **5 feet for each option beyond the first**.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Defilement Radius
| Spell Level  | Base Radius of Defiled Land |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | 5 ft.  |
|  2  | 10 ft. |
|  3  | 20 ft. |
|  4  | 30 ft. |
|  5  | 40 ft. |
|  6  | 50 ft. |
|  7  | 60 ft. |
|  8  | 70 ft. |
|  9  | 80 ft. |
}}

 {{width:7px}} Furthermore, not all terrain offers the same amount of power. Rich, fertile land has energy to offer in abundance, while harsher environs will cling jealously to what little life they have left. For example-- a caster defiling in a verdant jungle will require only a third of the land they normally would consume, while a caster in a barren tundra will require three times as much for the same effect. 

You must be touching the ground to attempt defiling and you cannot defile from already defiled land. The DM determines the type of terrain, with modifiers for each shown on the table below: 


{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Terrain | Examples | Modifier|
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  Desolate  | Salt flats, Silt Sea, the Dead Lands | x3 |
|  Barren  | Boulder field, stony barrens | x2 |
|  Infertile  | Cities, rocky badlands, scrubland | x1 |
|  Fertile  | Verdant grasslands, swamps, mud flats | 1/2 |
|  Abundant  | Forests, jungles, oases, gardens | 1/3 |
}}

## Defiler Effects

Whenever you defile, you gain defiler points based on the effect applied, as shown on the table below. These points immediately add to your Defiler Aura.

You can defile for a number of points equal to **half your caster level (rounded down, minimum of one)**. Effects with a greater cost, or multiple effects whose total exceeds this limit, cannot be cast. 

{{classTable,frame,decoration

| Defiler Effect  |  Point Cost |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Careful spell  | 1 |
|  Distant spell  | 1 |
|  Subtle spell  | 1 |
|  Empowered spell  | 2 |
|  Extended spell  | 2 |
|  Heightened spell  | 3 |
|  Quickened spell  | 4 |
|  Twinned spell  | 2 per spell level |
|  Cast spell without materials  | 1 per 100 ct value  |
}}

#### Careful spell
When casting a spell that requires a saving throw, choose a number of creatures up to your spellcasting modifier (minimum 1). Chosen targets automatically succeed on the saving throw.

#### Distant spell
Double the range of spells with at least a 5 ft range, or make a touch spell have a range of 30 ft.


#### Subtle spell
Cast a spell without  somatic or verbal components.
	

#### Empowered spell

Reroll damage dice equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum 1) and use those new rolls.

#### Extended spell

Double the duration of any spell with a duration of at least 1 minute, maximum 24 hours.

#### Heightened Spell

When casting a spell requiring a save, make one target have disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell.


#### Quickened spell

Change the casting time of any spell that has a casting time of 1 action to 1 bonus action.

#### Twinned spell

When casting a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you may also target a second creature in range. The spell cannot have more than one target at the level being cast.

#### Cast spell without material component

Cast any one spell without its material components.

### Recover spell slot

In addition to other Defilement effects, you can draw forth life energy to renew your arcane powers. As an action that provokes an attack of opportunity, you may regain an expended spell slot. If you do, you gain defiler points equal to 2 times the spell slot's level and defile the land as if you had cast a spell of that level.


### Effects on other creatures

Creatures except the defiler caught within the defiling radius at casting time experience pain and suffer a –2 penalty to all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws and ability checks until the start of the defiler's next turn. This effect stacks with itself.

Plant creatures also take necrotic damage equal to 5 x the level of the spell slot expended. This damage can't be reduced in any way. 

{{note
##### A Likely Story
 {{width:7px}} Carroz, a 4th level Arcanist, is being chased by Templars. Although taught by his mentor to never defile, he has nearly exhausted his spells. He knows the Sorcerer-King's gardens are nearby and figures, just this once, to save his life, he must draw more energy than the plants can handle. He is surprised at the volume of energy that comes at his behest, and nearby a century-old yew tree begins to wither.

Carroz restores a 1st level slot by taking on 2 defiler points. *The points he can use per casting are limited to half his level, in this case 2.* He feels slightly ill, then points his finger at the lead Templar and draws even more energy, destroying the ancient yew tree and twinning a 1st level *witch bolt* (2 more points) at the first two enemies he sees. Carroz now has a Defiler Aura of 4, enough that a foul light already lurks in his gaze. Breathing heavy, he looks about for witnesses, and sees only corpses. His fellow preservers need never know. 

When he escapes to meet with his Veiled Alliance contact, nobody shows. The next night, a veiled Cleric finds him in an alley and burns his sleeping form to cinders, leaving a withered branch of the defiled yew tree on his corpse. Once a defiler, always a defiler.  
}}

{{note
##### Defiler NPCs
 {{width:7px}} The DM decides how many defiler aura points any NPCs have, but if they aren't sure how many to put, a good rule of thumb is to give the NPC a defiler aura equal to 2 or 3 times their number of hit dice.

This rule can vary depending on the nature of the NPC and their attitude towards defilement-- for example, a powerful leader of the Veiled Alliance is unlikely to have any defiler aura despite their strength, while an exiled Arcanist of meager ability may have taken to desperate measures for survival,  developing a defiler aura of horrific heights.
}}

\column

## Defiler Aura

If you defile even once, you permanently gain an aura that marks you for those who can detect such auras, such as a powerful Druid.  As this aura grows, its effects worsen, causing those around you to unconsciously find you disturbing and untrustworthy. In addition, your body will begin to deteriorate and your mind may fracture and warp.

The table below details the effects you sustain as your aura grows. The effects can't be changed or undone except through a *conversion* spell.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Defiler Aura Table
| Defiler Aura   | Effect |
|:--:|:-----------:|
|  1+   | --1 on Charisma checks |
|  10+  | Another --1 on Charisma checks and a --2 Constitution score reduction.  |
|  20+  | An additional --2 on Charisma Checks. Alignment becomes evil. Corruption checks begin. |
|  30+  | Another --2 on Charisma checks and another --2 Constitution score reduction. |
|  40+  | Another --2 on Charisma checks |

}}

 {{width:7px}} Effects of an increase in your Defiler Aura take place after you have finished casting the spell or effect which prompted the increase. For example, a Templar at a Defiler Aura of 9 who casts a spell with the Subtle Spell effect added (which incurs 1 Defiler Point) would make their spellcasting check with a -1 to their Charisma modifier, rather than the -2 which is incurred at a Defiler Aura of 10. 
 
 ### Succumbing to Corruption
Wanton defilers must face the taint, a corruption which erodes body, mind, and spirit until they are a hollow wraith of their former selves. 

Upon reaching a Defiler Aura of 20 or higher, you begin making Corruption checks. At the end of a long rest, you must make a Constitution saving throw with the DC equal to half your Defiler Aura (rounded up). If you fail this saving throw 3 times in your life, you become an undead NPC known as a T'liz (see the Athasian Bestiary) under DM control.

### Purging the Taint
Those who have chosen to defile, as well as those tainted unwillingly, have a chance of redemption. It is possible, given the aid of a powerful preserver, to purge the taint from their bodies.

Characters who choose to do so must locate a Druid (whose Challenge Rating or level is at least equal to the character's) who would be willing to cast a *conversion* spell on them. The Druid might also request some grand quest or proof of their dedication to abandoning the path of the defiler.

## Absorb Elements
*1st-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 reaction, which you take when you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: 1 round
The spell captures the incoming energy of attacks, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

## Acid Arrow
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder's stomach)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target.

On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Acid Splash
*Conjuration cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature you can see within range, or choose two creatures you can see within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

\column

## Aganazzar's Scorcher
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a red dragon's scale)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Aid
*2nd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target's hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Alarm
*1st-level abjuration* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

## Alter Self
*2nd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

***Change Appearance.*** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

***Natural Weapons.*** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.

\column

## Animal Friendship
*1st-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a morsel of food)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.


## Animal Messenger
*2nd-level enchantment* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a morsel of food)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a bat, critic lizard, or kes'trekel. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in a Templar uniform" or "a one-armed Tarek wearing a red tunic." You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd. 

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/R6Qc40m/alter-308.jpg' style='position:relative; top:570px; left:-715px; height:440px; width:310px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Animal Shapes
*8th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 24 hours
Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.

The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

\column

## Animate Dead
*3rd-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (statistics for both can be found in the Athasian Bestiary).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

     
<img src='https://i.ibb.co/r6pNfDF/deep-magic-raise-dead-dnd.webp' style='position:relative; top:490px; left:-750px; height:500px; width:450px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Animate Objects
*5th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four, and Huge targets count as eight. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Animated Object Statistics
| Size | HP | AC | Attack | Str | Dex |
|:-----|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| Tiny                 | 20     | 18  | +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage | 4 | 18 |
| Small               | 25     | 16 |  +6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage | 6 | 14 |
| Medium               | 40     | 13  |  +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage | 10 | 12 |
| Large             | 50     | 10   |  +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage | 14 | 10 |
| Huge             | 80     | 10   |  +8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage | 18 | 6 |
}}


An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over.

If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

\column

## Antilife Shell
*5th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (10-foot radius)
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.

The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/FzY50Z3/antimagic-310.jpg' style='position:relative; top:280px; left:-380px; height:700px; width:400px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Antimagic Field
*8th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of  iron filings)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you.  Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Spells, psionic powers, and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or an incredibly powerful entity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

***Targeted Effects.*** Spells and other magical effects, such as *magic missile* and *charm person*, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

***Areas of Magic.*** The area of another spell or magical effect, such as *fireball*, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a *wall of fire* are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall.

***Spells.*** Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

***Magic Items.*** The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a *+1 longsword* in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.

A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

***Magical Travel.*** Teleportation and similar travel also fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the *nomad’s tiny hut* spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.

***Creatures and Objects.*** A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

***Dispel Magic.*** Spells and magical effects such as *dispel magic* have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different *antimagic field* spells don't nullify each other.

\column

## Antipathy / Sympathy
*8th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect, or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)
**Duration:** :: 10 days
This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature, or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as belgoi, gith, or t'liz. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

***Antipathy.*** The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

***Sympathy.*** The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.

If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

***Ending the Effect.*** If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

## Arcane Eye
*4th-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.

You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction. As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

## Arcane Gate
*6th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  500 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.

Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.

\column

## Arcane Lock
*2nd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (silver dust worth at least 25 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting *knock* on the object suppresses *arcane lock* for 10 minutes.

While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.

## Armor of Sielba
*1st-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a cup of water)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increase by 5 for each slot level above 1st.

## Arms of Kalid-Ma
*1st-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (10-foot radius)
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You invoke the power of Kalid-Ma, the Dark Hunger of Kalidnay. 

Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and can't take reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

## Augury
*2nd-level divination* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 ct)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling lizard bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
* Weal, for good results
* Woe, for bad results
* Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
* Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

## Aura of Life
*4th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (30-foot radius)
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Life-preserving energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) has resistance to necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum can't be reduced. In addition, a nonhostile, living creature regains 1 hit point when it starts its turn in the aura with 0 hit points.

\column

## Aura of Purity
*4th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action

**Duration:** :: 1 minute
Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell.

At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are still in the Gray, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

While in the Gray, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in monochrome, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away.

You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.

If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8.

**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 50 ct)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of energy at a creature that you can see within range. You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 3d8 damage of the type you chose.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

*6th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  150 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at least 500 ct)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius sphere from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 6th.

## Circle of Power
*5th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (30-foot radius)
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Arcane energy radiates from you, distorting  magical energy within 30 feet. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. For the duration, each friendly creature in the area (including you) has advantage on saving throws against spells, psionic powers, and other magical effects. Additionally, when an affected creature succeeds on a saving throw to take only half damage against a spell, psionic power, or magical effect, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw.

## Clairvoyance
*3rd-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  1 mile
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 ct, such as a jeweled hearing horn or a glass eye)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.

When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As an action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from *see invisibility* or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.

\column

## Clone
*8th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 ct and at least 1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned, which the spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 ct that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold the creature being cloned, such as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with salt water)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside the vessel used in the spell’s casting and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.

At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return.

The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.

## Cloud of Daggers
*2nd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a sliver of glass)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Cloudkill
*5th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured. 

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

## Color Spray
*1st-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (15-foot cone)
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)
**Duration:** :: 1 round
A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.

\column

## Command
*1st-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: 1 round
You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target is prevented from following your command, the spell ends.

***Approach.*** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

***Drop.*** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

***Flee.*** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

***Grovel.*** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

***Halt.*** The target stays where it is and takes no actions.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Commune
*5th-level divination* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (incense and a vial of arcanic water, a symbol of the elements, or other focus)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You contact your Sorcerer-King, elemental, or another suitably powerful being and inquire about the mysteries before you. This communion can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A *greater restoration* spell cast on you ends this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

If you cast the spell twice or more before your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.

## Commune with Nature
*5th-level divination* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of your surroundings. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In natural underground settings like caves, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn't function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.

You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:
* terrain and bodies of water
* prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
* powerful aberrations, beasts, fey, elementals, monstrosities, or undead
* influence from other planes of existence
* buildings

For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.

\column

## Compelled Duel
*1st-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your magical demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.

The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.


## Comprehend Languages
*1st-level divination* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language.

## Cone of Cold
*5th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (60-foot cone)
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

## Confusion
*4th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (three nut shells)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| d10 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | Behavior |
|:--:|:-----------:|
|  1   | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction, determined by a d8.  The creature doesn’t take an action this turn. |
|  2-6  | The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.  |
|  7-8  | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a random creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. |
|  9-10  | The creature can act and move normally. |

}}

 {{width:7px}} At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each  level above 4th.

## Conjure Barrage
*3rd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (60-foot cone)
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (one piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.

## Conjure Volley

**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  150 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (one piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon)

## Contagion
*5th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 7 days
Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is poisoned. 

At the end of each of the poisoned target's turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saving throws, it is no longer poisoned, and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell's duration.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.

***Blinding Sickness.*** Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.

***Filth Fever.*** A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

***Flesh Rot.*** The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

***Mindfire.*** The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the *confusion* spell during combat.

***Seizure.*** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

***Slimy Doom.*** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

## Contingency
*6th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 ct)
**Duration:** :: 10 days
Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting *contingency*, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a *contingency* cast with *water breathing* might stipulate that *water breathing* comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then *contingency* ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one *contingency* spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another *contingency* spell on you ends. Also, *contingency* ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

## Continual Flame
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Control Flames
*Transmutation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)
You choose a nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:
* You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.
* You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.
* You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.
* You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

\column

## Control Water
*4th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  300 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a dust mote and water drop)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water or silt inside a an area of up to 100 cubic feet. Choose one of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

***Flood.*** You cause the level of all standing water or silt in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water or silt spills over onto land. If you choose an area in a large body of water or silt, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with to the other side and have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water or silt level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood lasts. 

***Part Water.*** You cause water or silt in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water or silt forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water or silt then slowly fills in the trench over  the next round until the normal level is restored.

***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water or silt in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water or silt has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water or silt continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. 

***Whirlpool.*** This effect requires a body of water or silt at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water or silt within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If the whirlpool is in silt, increase this DC by 2.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and swims free. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away with disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.

Objects entering the vortex take 2d8 bludgeoning damage, which repeats each round they remain.

**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  Self (5-mile radius)
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 8 hours
You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don't have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal. When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following table and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.

{{classTable,frame,decoration

## Control Winds
*5th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  300 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted.

***Gusts.*** A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that enter or leave the cube or pass through it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.

***Downdraft.*** You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

***Updraft.*** You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom edge. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

## Conversion
*5th level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: V, S, M (Burning incense, along with various rare plants and herbs worth at least 500 Cp, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
This spell removes the burden of acts of defiling from an arcane spellcaster. The caster's Druid level must be equal to or higher than the target's arcane spellcaster level.

If the defiler seeking atonement is truly repentant and desires setting right their destruction of plant life, the spell causes the following effects:

* The target’s Defiler Aura is reduced to zero.
* The targets penalty to Charisma checks caused by defiling are halved (round down, minimum 0).
* The target's reductions to their Constitution score caused by defiling are halved (round down, minimum 0).
* If the target's alignment was changed to evil from defiling, it reverts back to the alignment it was before the change.
* If the target defiled while under some sort of magical or psionic compulsion or was otherwise unwilling, both the target and the caster gain 1 point of exhaustion at the end of spell. However, if any of the defiling was deliberate and willful, both the target and the caster instead gain 2 points of exhaustion at the end of spell.

A creature can only benefit from this spell once. Any future attempts will automatically fail.

If *conversion* is cast on a defiler not truly seeking atonement, then the spell fails and the target instead takes 6d6 necrotic damage that can't be reduced in any way, then gains 2 points of exhaustion.

If the spell is successful and the target ever defiles again, they immediately add 10 points to their Defiler Aura and suffer the associated effects.

## Cordon of Arrows
*2nd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  5 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (four or more arrows or bolts)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunition—arrows or crossbow bolts—in the ground within range and lay magic upon them to protect an area. Until the spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition remains.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of ammunition that can be affected increases by two for each slot level above 2nd.

**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a bonfire on solid ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube.

## Create Homunculus
*6th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (clay, ash, and mandrake root, all of which the spell consumes, and a jewel-encrusted dagger worth at least 1,000 ct)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking 2d4 piercing damage that can’t be reduced in any way. You then place a bloody hand onto the spell's other components, transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus.

The statistics of the homunculus are in the Athasian Bestiary. It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus’s hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point. and the change to your and the homunculus’s hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can’t be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus‘s death.

You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.

## Create or Destroy Water
*1st-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet

**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You either create or destroy water.

***Create Water.*** You create up to a half gallon of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 2-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create an additional half gallon of water, increase the size of the rain cube by 2 feet, or destroy an additional 10 gallons of water for each slot level above 1st.

## Create Undead
*6th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 ct black onyx stone for each corpse)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The Athasian Bestiary has statistics for these creatures.)

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.

**Duration:** :: Special
You pull wisps of shadow from the Gray to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

{{classTable,frame,decoration

}}

 {{width:7px}} Using any material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail.

**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.

The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.

On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.

Seven star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the spell ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit the target takes 4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended. The spell ends early if you expend the last mote.

If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.

*Evocation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

## Danse Macabre
*5th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Threads of dark power leap from your fingers to pierce up to five Small or Medium corpses you can see within range. Each corpse immediately stands up and becomes undead. You decide whether it is a zombie or a skeleton (the statistics for zombies and skeletons are in the Athasian Bestiary), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. 

You can use a bonus action to mentally command the creatures you make with this spell, issuing the same command to all of them. To receive the command, a creature must be within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the creatures will take and where they will move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or passageway against your foes. if you issue no commands, the creatures do nothing except defend themselves against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creatures continue to follow it until their task is complete.

The creatures are under your control until the spell ends, after which they become inanimate once more. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you animate up to two additional corpses for each slot level above 5th.

**Components:** ::  V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

## Darkvision
*2nd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours

When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.

If you’re within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.

## Daylight
*3rd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.

If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

## Death Knell
*Necromancy cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).

## Delayed Blast Fireball
*7th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  150 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes. The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.

## Demiplane
*8th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.

Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.

## Destructive Wave
*5th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (30-foot radius)
**Components:** ::  V

Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

\column

## Detect Magic
*1st-level divination* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.


## Detect Poison and Disease
*1st-level divination* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a yew leaf)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

## Detect the Supernatural
*1st-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

## Detect Thoughts
*2nd-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a copper piece)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.

\column

## Dimension Door
*4th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  500 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet."

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.

If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.

## Disguise Self
*1st-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

## Disintegrate
*6th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by *wall of force*.

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.

## Dispel the Supernatural
*5th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action

**Components:** ::  V, S, M (arcanic water or powdered silver and iron)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from elementals, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.

***Break Enchantment.*** As your action, you can touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. That creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed.

***Dismissal.*** As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane. Undead are sent to the Gray, and fey become one with nature.

## Dispel Magic
*3rd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

## Divination
*4th-level divination* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a Sorcerer-King, their servants, or another suitably powerful being. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

## Divine Favor

**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Divine Word
*7th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You utter a divine word, imbued with the power of the Sorcerer-Kings. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:
* 50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
* 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes
* 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
* 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly

Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn't there already) and can't return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *wish* spell.

## Dominate Beast
*4th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your allies are fighting it, or be charmed by you for the duration. 

While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction, it defends itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow. During this time, you can use your own reaction to cause the creature to use a reaction. Each time the target takes damage, it can attempt to break the spell with a new Wisdom saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When cast at 5th-level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When cast at 6th-level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When cast at 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

## Dream
*5th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Special
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a  quill plucked from a sleeping bird)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
This spell shapes a creature's dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don't sleep, such as Thri-kreen, can't be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enter a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of their surroundings, but can't take actions or move.

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.

You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.

If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.

## Druid Grove
*6th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (mistletoe, which the spell consumes, that was harvested with a golden sickle under the light of a full moon)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
You invoke the spirits to protect an area outdoors or underground. The area can be as small as a 30-foot cube or as large as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and other structures are excluded from the affected area. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.

The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that offers the same immunity.

The entire warded area radiates magic. A successful *dispel magic* cast on the area removes only one of the effects, not the entire area. That spell’s caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.

***Solid Fog.*** You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating in the air.

***Grasping Undergrowth.*** You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren’t filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by an *entangle* spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.

***Grove Guardians.*** You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the same statistics as an awakened tree (which appears in the Athasian Bestiary), except they can’t speak, and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing. The grove guardians can‘t leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible.

***Additional Spell Effect.*** You can place one of the following magical effects within the warded area: 
* *Gust of wind* in two locations of your choice
* *Spike growth* in one location of your choice
* *Wind wall* in two locations of your choice


## Druidcraft

**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

* You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of musk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
* You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

## Dust Devil
*2nd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of dust)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose an unoccupied 5-foot cube of air that you can see within range. An elemental force that resembles a dust devil appears in the cube and lasts for the spell's duration.

Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dust devil. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or light gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Earth Tremor
*1st-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw.

If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with every 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

## Earthbind
*2nd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  300 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Earthen Grasp
*2nd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small hand made of clay)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration. As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes from the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.

\column

## Earthquake
*8th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  500 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

***Fissures.*** Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

***Structures.*** The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.

Moreover, the target loses any resistance to that damage type until the spell ends.

**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You reach into the mind of one creature you can see and force it to make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature automatically succeeds if it is immune to being frightened. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the spell ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it’s using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

If the target is a creature, everything it wears and carries changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

***Enlarge.*** The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.

***Panicked.*** The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move.

When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Gray. It ignores illusions. 

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.

**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.

While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

**Range:** ::  60 feet

**Duration:** :: 1 minute

## Feeblemind
*8th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  150 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.

At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.

The spell can also be ended by *greater restoration*, *heal*, or *wish*.

The target is blinded and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0. The target has resistance to all damage except psychic damage. If the target is diseased or poisoned when you cast the spell, or becomes diseased or poisoned while under the spell’s effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the spell ends.

## Find Familiar
*1st-level conjuration* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (10 ct worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, hurrum beetle, critic lizard, jankx, kes'trekel, poisonous snake, rat, scorpion, spider, or something similar. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast. 

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.

\column

::::::::::::

 {{width:7px}} While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

## Find Greater Steed
*4th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a loyal, majestic mount. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the spirit takes on a form you choose: an ankheg, boneclaw baazrag, dragonnel, griffon, soldier kank, or tigone. The creature has the statistics provided in the Athasian Bestiary for the chosen form, though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type. Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

You control the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount. The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re-summons the bonded mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed.

You can’t have more than one mount bonded by this spell or *find steed* at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently.

Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.

\column

## Find Steed
*2nd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a carru, erdlu, kank drone, or jhakar (for PCs of Small size). Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds. The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit.

While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.

When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.

While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically.

You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

## Find the Path
*6th-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools—such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes-worth 100 ct and an object from the location you wish to find)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 day
This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn't specific (such as "an id fiend's lair"), the spell fails.

For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.

## Find Traps
*2nd-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the *alarm* spell, a *glyph of warding*, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

\column

## Finger of Death
*7th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.

## Fire Bolt
*Evocation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

## Fire Shield
*4th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes
Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.

A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  150 feet

The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects that aren't worn or carried.

## Flame Arrows
*3rd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch

**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You touch a quiver containing arrows or bolts. When a target is hit by a ranged weapon attack using a piece of ammunition drawn from the quiver, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The spell's magic ends on the piece of ammunition when it hits or misses, and the spell ends when twelve pieces of ammunition have been drawn from the quiver.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of pieces of ammunition you can affect with this spell increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

\column

**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (leaf of sumac)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.

The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

## Flaming Sphere
*2nd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Flesh to Stone

**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.

A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.

\column

## Floating Disk
*1st-level conjuration* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

## Fly
*3rd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.

## Forbiddance
*6th-level abjuration* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a sprinkling of arcanic water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 ct)
**Duration:** :: 1 day
You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the *gate* spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Elemental Plane, the Gray, or the *plane shift* spell.

In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell). When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.

The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another *forbiddance* spell. If you cast *forbiddance* every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.

\column

## Forcecage
*7th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  100 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 ct)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. 

This spell can't be dispelled by *dispel magic*.

## Foresight
*9th-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)

This spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.

**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.

## Friends
*Enchantment cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  S, M (a small amount of makeup applied to the face as this spell is cast)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn't hostile toward you. When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM's discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.

## Frostbite
*Evocation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous

## Gaseous Form
*3rd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour 
You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn't affected.

While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast spells.

## Geas
*5th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: 30 days
You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or *wish* spell also ends it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

*2nd-level necromancy* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse's eyes, which must remain there for the duration)
**Duration:** :: 10 days
You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become undead.

The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of spells such as *raise dead*.

## Giant Insect
*4th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.

## Glibness
*8th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.

## Globe of Invulnerability
*6th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (10-foot radius)
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.

Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

## Glyph of Warding
*3rd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled or triggered
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph upon either a surface (such as a table or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or a chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet, the glyph is broken, ending the spell with no effect.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.

You decide what the glyph's trigger is when it is first cast. Triggers can be anything from standing on the glyph, to interacting with a glyphed object, or merely seeing the glyph, and anything between. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, only affecting Changelings), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

Choose one effect when the glyph is cast:

***Explosive Runes.*** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Spell Glyph.*** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.

## Grasping Vine
*4th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You conjure a vine that sprouts from the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. When you cast this spell, you can direct the vine to lash out at a creature within 30 feet of it that you can see. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be pulled 20 feet directly toward the vine.

Until the spell ends, you can direct the vine to lash out at the same creature or another one as a bonus action on each of your turns.

## Gray Guise
*7th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Up to 8 hours
You step into the border regions of the Gray, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Gray for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away.

While within the Gray, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't in the Gray can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects and effects that aren't in the Gray, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.

When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are already in the Gray.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.

**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

## Greater Invisibility
*4th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person.

* Any reduction to one of the target's ability scores
* One effect reducing the target's hit point maximum

## Green-Flame Blade
*Evocation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (5-foot radius)
**Components:** ::  V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 bit)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 17th level (3d8 and 3d8).


## Guardian of Faith
*4th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield emblazoned with the symbol of your Sorcerer-King.

Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.

## Guardian of Nature

**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A nature spirit answers your call and transforms you into a powerful guardian. The transformation lasts until the spell ends. You choose one of the following forms to assume: Primal Beast or Great Tree.

## Guards and Wards
*6th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone, a knotted string, a drop of mekillot blood, and a  rod worth at least 10 ct)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares, or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.

When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that offers the same immunity.

*Guards and wards* creates the following effects within the warded area.

***Corridors.*** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

***Doors.*** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if by an *arcane lock* spell. In addition, you can conceal up to ten doors (equivalent to *minor illusion*'s illusory object) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

***Stairs.*** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the *web* spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while *guards and wards* lasts.

***Other Spell Effect.*** You can place  one of the following magical effects within the warded area:
* Place *dancing lights* in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as *guards and wards* lasts.
* Place *magic mouth* in two locations.
* Place *stinking cloud* in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while *guards and wards* lasts.
* Place a *gust of wind* in one corridor or room.
* Place a *suggestion* in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the *suggestion* mentally.

The whole warded area radiates magic. A *dispel magic* cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.

**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Gust
*Transmutation cantrip*

* You create a harmless sensory effect using air, such as causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters shut, or your clothing to ripple in a breeze.

\column

## Gust of Wind
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (60-foot line)
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a legume seed)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

## Hail of Thorns
*1st-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d10).

## Hallow
*5th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  24 hours
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (herbs and  incense worth at least 1,000 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You touch a point and infuse an area around it with arcane or elemental power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect of a *hallow* spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.

First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can't enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is freed from these effects upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.

Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or one offered by the DM. Some effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific entity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as Dray. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.

***Courage.*** Affected creatures can't be frightened while in the area.

***Darkness.*** Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can't illuminate the area.

***Daylight.*** Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used for this spell can't extinguish the light.

***Energy Protection.*** Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

***Energy Vulnerability.*** Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

***Everlasting Rest.*** Dead bodies interred in the area can't be turned into undead.

***Extradimensional Interference.*** Affected creatures can't move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.

***Fear.*** Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.

***Silence.*** No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.

***Tongues.*** Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don't share a common language.

## Hallucinatory Terrain
*4th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  300 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A patch of quicksand can be made to seem like an oasis, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

## Hamanu's Aegis
*1st-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (arcanic water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

## Hand of the Giant
*5th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.

***Clenched Fist.*** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.

***Forceful Hand.*** The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.

***Grasping Hand.*** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

***Interposing Hand.*** The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

\column

## Harm
*6th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.

## Haste

**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

## Heal
*6th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Choose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This spell also ends blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting the target. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.

You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can’t heal constructs or undead.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the Spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S

**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You bring forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and the beneficial effects don't set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve creatures can partake of the feast.

A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.

**Duration:** :: 10 days
You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration. To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.

## Imprisonment
*9th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a portrait or statuette in the target's likeness, and a component matching the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 ct per Hit Die of the target)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You magically restrain a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected, the target doesn't age, breathe,  or require food and drink. Divination spells and clairsentience powers can't locate or perceive the target.

Choose one effect when first casting the spell:

***Burial.*** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can anything teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.

Special component:  a small mithral orb.

***Chaining.*** The target is restrained by chains and cannot move or be moved until the spell ends. 

Special component: a fine chain of precious steel.

***Hedged Prison.*** The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.

Special component: a jade model of the prison.

***Minimus Containment.*** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. The target can see out, and others can see in, but no sound, object, or other effect can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.

Special component: a large gemstone.

***Slumber.*** The target falls into a comatose slumber from which they cannot be roused. 

Special component: rare soporific herbs.

***Ending the Spell.*** During the casting of the spell, you can specify a condition that will end the spell and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name or identity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

A *dispel magic* spell can end the spell only if cast at 9th-level, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it. You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: "Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones.

*4th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
You touch a creature and grant it  protection from death. The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends. If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would instantaneously kill it without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.

**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light.

The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

## Lightning Arrow
*3rd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell’s duration, the weapon’s ammunition, or the weapon itself if it’s a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's normal damage.

Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a Seedling or a baazrag), so long as you have seen such a creature up close —within 30 feet— at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a *polymorph* spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.

## Locate Object
*2nd-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a forked twig)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object's location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close —within 30 feet— at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

\column

**Components:** ::  V, M (a drop of pitch mixed with a drop of mercury)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.

Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Maelstrom

**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)

## Mage Hand
*Conjuration cantrip*

**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

\column

## Magic Circle
*3rd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (arcanic water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:
* The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
* The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
* Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.

When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.

## Magic Jar
*6th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 ct)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoid’s body.

You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a *Hamanu's aegis* or *magic circle* spell can't be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move or take actions at all. While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

\column

## Magic Missile
*1st-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.

## Magic Mouth
*2nd-level illusion* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

## Magic Stone
*Transmutation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet.

If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whether the attack hits or misses, the spell then ends on the stone.

If you cast this spell again, the spell ends on any pebbles still affected by your previous casting.

## Magic Weapon
*2nd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.

\column

## Major Image
*3rd-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a bog wader's stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

## Mass Cure Wounds
*5th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

## Mass Heal
*9th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

## Mass Healing Word
*3rd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

\column

## Mass Polymorph
*9th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.

Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or half the target’s level, if the target doesn’t have a  challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.

Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can’t be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can’t speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech. 

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

## Mass Suggestion
*6th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.

## Maze
*8th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze. 

The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a Minotaur automatically succeeds).

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

\column

## Meld into Stone
*3rd-level transmutation* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell.

You otherwise can't move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.


## Mending
*Transmutation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (two lodestones)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Mental Prison
*6th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and perceives the area to be horrifying and mortally dangerous in some way. Creatures immune to being charmed cannot fail. 

The target can’t see or hear anything and is restrained for the spell’s duration. If the target is moved out of range, succeeds on a melee attack, or reaches any part of its body through the illusions, it takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.

## Message
*Transmutation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
**Duration:** :: 1 round
You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

## Meteor Swarm
*9th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  1 mile
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.

The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't  worn or carried.

\column

## Mighty Fortress
*8th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  1 mile
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.

The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress’s outer wall.

A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its  walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can havestone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.

A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the *unseen servant* spell.

The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM’s discretion.

After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.

Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

## Mind Blank
*8th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, clairsentience powers, and the charmed condition. The spell even foils *wish* spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target's mind or to gain information about the target.

## Mind Sliver
*Enchantment cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: 1 round
You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

## Mind Spike
*2nd-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

\column

## Mind Whip
*2nd-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: 1 round
You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can't take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell's other effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Minor Illusion
*Illusion cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  S, M (a bit of fleece)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream.

It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a Leonin's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

## Minute Meteors
*3rd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

## Mirage Arcane
*7th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  Sight
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 10 days
You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A patch of quicksand can be made to seem like an oasis, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.

Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

\column

## Mirror Image
*2nd-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

## Mislead
*5th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

## Misty Step
*2nd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

## Modify Memory
*5th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

A *remove curse* or *greater restoration* spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).

## Mold Earth
*Transmutation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)
You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:
* If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.
* You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
* If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

## Moonbeam
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Move Earth
*6th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils—clay, loam, and sand)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 2 hours
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.

Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.

This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse. Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

## Negative Energy Flood
*5th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, M (a broken bone and a square of black silk)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead. it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a zombie at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the zombie are in the Athasian Bestiary.

If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn’t make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.

\column

## Nomad's Tiny Hut
*3rd-level evocation* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small crystal bead)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can't extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.


## Nondetection
*3rd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 ct sprinkled over the target, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination spells and clairsentience powers. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can't be targeted by any divination magic or clarisentience powers, and cannot be perceived through magical scrying sensors.

## Nystul's Magic Aura
*2nd-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small square of silk)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells and clairsentience powers reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by another creature.

When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

**False Aura.** You change the way the target appears to spells, powers, and other magical effects, such as *detect magic*, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.

**Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells, powers, and other magical effects that detect creature types, such as a Crusader's Sorcerous Sense or the trigger of a *symbol* spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.

## Otiluke's Freezing Sphere
*6th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  300 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

## Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
*4th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration. Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures. A *disintegrate* spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

## Ovik's Irresistible Dance
*6th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this spell. 

A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.

## Pass without Trace
*2nd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

## Passwall
*5th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening's dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/ZX0Kz1V/ovik-dance-383.jpg' style='position:relative; top:540px; left:-325px; height:450px; width:360px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Phantasmal Force
*2nd-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

\column

## Phantasmal Killer
*4th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

## Phantom Steed
*3rd-level illusion* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
A Large quasi-real, sygralike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding sygra, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

## Planar Ally
*6th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a Sorcerer-King, a primordial elemental, a powerful sprit of the land, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fey loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).

When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might ask for some inexplicable piece of forgotten lore or treasure to be reclaimed, while an elemental might demand a living sacrifice or a parcel of land. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 ct per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 ct per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 ct per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.

Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.

If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

## Planar Binding
*5th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted *magic circle* in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.

## Plane Shift
*7th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 ct, attuned to a particular plane of existence)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the Elemental Plane's Realm of Fire or the Gray, and you appear in that plane.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a *teleportation circle* on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the *teleportation circle* is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.

Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.

## Plant Growth
*3rd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action or 8 hours
**Range:** ::  150 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.

If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.

If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

\column

## Poison Spray
*Conjuration cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

## Polymorph
*4th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

## Power Word Heal
*9th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

## Power Word Kill
*9th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

## Power Word Pain
*7th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You speak a word of power that causes waves of intense pain to assail one creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to crippling pain. Otherwise, the spell has no effect  on it. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being charmed.

While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.

\column

## Power Word Stun
*8th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

## Prayer of Healing
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

## Prestidigitation
*Transmutation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Up to 1 hour
This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
* You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
* You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
* You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
* You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
* You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.


If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

## Primal Savagery
*Transmutation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You channel primal magic to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 acid damage.

After you make the attack, your teeth or fingernails return to normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

\column

## Primordial Ward
*6th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage for the spell's duration.

When you take damage of one of those types, you can use your reaction to gain immunity to that type of damage, including against the triggering damage. If you do so, the resistances end, and you have the immunity until the end of your next turn, at which time the spell ends.

## Prismatic Spray
*7th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (60-foot cone)
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.

**1. Red.** The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much  on a successful one.

**2. Orange.** The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**3. Yellow.** The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**4. Green.** The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**5. Blue.** The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much  on a successful one.

**6. Indigo.** On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; three of either trigger the effect.

**7. Violet.** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Gray.)

**8. Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.

## Prismatic Wall
*9th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes
A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.

The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below. 
The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. *Antimagic field* has no effect on the wall and *dispel magic* can affect only the violet layer.

\column
:::::::::

 {{width:10px}} **1. Red.** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.

**2. Orange.** The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.

**3. Yellow.** The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.

**4. Green.** The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A *passwall* spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.

**5. Blue.** The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.

**6. Indigo.** On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.

While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a *daylight* spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.

**7. Violet.** On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Gray.) This layer is destroyed by a *dispel magic* spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

## Produce Flame
*Conjuration cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes
A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again. You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. 

When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

## Programmed Illusion
*6th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 ct)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

\column

## Project Image
*7th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  500 miles
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 ct)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 day
You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

## Protection from Energy
*3rd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

## Protection from Poison
*2nd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Psychic Scream
*9th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You unleash the power of your mind to blast the intellect of up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. Creatures that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are unaffected.

Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 psychic damage and is stunned. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned. If a target is killed by this damage, its head explodes, assuming it has one. 

A stunned target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the stunning effect ends.

## Purify Food and Drink
*1st-level transmutation* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
All nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.

## Pyrotechnics
*2nd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Choose an area of nonmagical flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

**Fireworks.** The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.

**Smoke.** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

\column

## Raise Dead
*5th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a --4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

## Ray of Enfeeblement
*2nd-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.

At the end of each of the target's turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Ray of Frost
*Evocation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

## Ray of Sickness
*1st-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

## Recall
*6th-level conjuration* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 ct)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.

At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item's name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.

If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn't transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.

*Dispel magic* or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell's effect.

\column

## Regenerate
*7th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a beetle and arcanic water)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points, and 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns for the duration of the spell (10 hit points each minute).

The target's severed body pieces (fingers, legs, tails, etc), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantly knits the limb to the stump. 

## Reincarnate
*5th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (rare oils and incense worth at least 1,000 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and calls the soul to that body. If the target's soul isn't free or willing , the spell fails.

The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, determined when the DM either chooses a form from or rolls a d100 on the table below.

{{classTable,frame,decoration

## Rejuvenate 
*5th level Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 Minute
**Range:** :: Self (50 ft radius)
**Components:** :: V, S, M (A seed of any type and a drop of water, both of which the spell consumes.)
**Duration:** :: 7 Days
This spell grants an area of ground the ability to support vegetation. The spell may be cast on any ground short of solid rock, including sand, rocky sand or soil, and dust. In the case of ground made barren by defiler magic, *rejuvenate* dispels the ground’s sterility, making it immediately capable of supporting vegetation. 

The spell affects the ground in a 50 foot radius from the caster. Once cast, the soil is enriched and moistened, and a blanket of fine grass emerges instantly.

Once cast, the moist soil and grass are not magical, and are subject to all natural forces upon them. They will, however, survive a week in even the worst of conditions. *Rejuvenate* otherwise lasts until a spellcaster uses defiling to destroy the vegetation.

This spell automatically fails if cast by any creature with at least 1 point in a defiler aura.


## Remove Curse
*3rd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks the curse upon its owner so it can be removed or discarded.

## Resistance
*Abjuration cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a miniature cloak)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.

\column

## Resurrection
*7th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.

This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a --4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

## Revenge of the Land
*5th level evocation*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self (30-foot radius)
**Components:** :: V, S, M (a live seed pushed into the ground at your feet)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The life energy of the earth is channeled in translucent arcs of energy that radiate from the seed in the ground at your feet and unerringly seek out defilers before returning to the ground. This spell only affects a creature with at least one point in a defiler aura. A defiler that starts its turn within or moves into the spell's radius must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the defiler takes 4d8 force damage or half as much on a successful save.

## Reverse Gravity
*7th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  100 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.

If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

## Revivify
*3rd-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

## Sacred Flame
*Evocation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

\column

## Sanctuary
*1st-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.

## Scatter
*6th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
The air quivers around up to five creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist this spell. You teleport each affected target to an unoccupied space that you can see within 120 feet of you. That space must be on the ground or on a floor.

## Scorching Ray
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.

Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.

## Scrying
*5th-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  10 minutes
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 ct, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with arcanic water)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Knowledge| Save Modifier |
|:--:|:-----------:|
| Secondhand (knowledge of target)  | +5 |
| Firsthand (you have met the target) | +0  |
| Familiar (you know the target well) | --5 |


| Connection | Save Modifier |
|:--:|:-----------:|
| Likeness or picture  | --2 |
| Possession or garment  | --4  |
| Lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | --10 |

}}

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist. Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

\column

## Searing Smite
*1st-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to the target and causes the target to ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

## Secret Stash
*4th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 ct, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 ct)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You hide a chest, and all its contents, within the Gray. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).

While the chest remains in the Gray, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Gray by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell's effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is in the Gray, it is irretrievably lost.

## See Invisibility
*2nd-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Gray. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.

## Seeming
*5th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell. 

The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

\column

## Sending
*3rd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Unlimited
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)
**Duration:** :: 1 round
You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.

## Sequester
*7th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination spells or clairsentience powers, and cannot be perceived through scrying sensors created by such. If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

## Shadow King's Blade
*2nd-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You weave together threads of shadow to create a sword of solidified gloom in your hand. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d8 psychic damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60). In addition, when you use the sword to attack a target that is in dim light or darkness, you make the attack roll with advantage. If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 3rd or 4th level spell slot, the damage increases to 3d8. When you cast it using a 5th or 6th level spell slot, the damage increases to 4d8. When you cast it using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases to 5d8.

## Shadow Ward
*4th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (an undead eyeball encased in a gem worth at least 150 ct)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Flame-like shadows wreathe your body until the spell ends, causing you to become heavily obscured to others. The shadows turn dim light within 10 feet of you into darkness, and bright light in the same area to dim light.

Until the spell ends, you have resistance to radiant damage. In addition, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, the shadows lash out at that creature, dealing it 2d8 necrotic damage.

\column

## Shape Water
*Transmutation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)
You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. 

You manipulate it in one of the following ways:
* You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.
* You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.
* You change the water's color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.
* You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/jDvgz7X/water-shape-397.jpg' style='position:relative; top:430px; left:-390px; height:550px; width:410px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Shapechange
*9th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 ct, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.

You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.

You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.

During this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.

\column

## Shatter
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a chip of mica)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Shield
*1st-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the *magic missile* spell
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 1 round
An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from *magic missile*.

## Shield of Faith
*1st-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.

## Shillelagh
*Transmutation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
A bludgeoning weapon made of wood that you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

## Shocking Grasp
*Evocation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

## Sickening Radiance
*4th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 radiant damage, and it suffers one level of exhaustion and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being invisible. The light and any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.

\column

## Silence
*2nd-level illusion* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it.

Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

## Silent Image
*1st-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

## Silt Horror's Tentacles
*4th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a piece of tentacle)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.


## Silt Walk
*3rd-level transmutation* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a piece of cork)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as silt, water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.

If you target a creature submerged in a liquid (including silt), the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.

\column

## Simulacrum
*7th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  12 hours
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (sand or silt in quantities sufficient to make a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature's body placed inside the sand or silt; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 ct, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from sand or silt, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.

The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.

If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 ct per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to the elements of its form and collapses instantly.

If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.



## Skill Empowerment
*5th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Your magic deepens a creature’s understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the spell ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill.

You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn’t already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.

## Skywrite
*2nd-level transmutation* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Sight
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You cause up to ten words to form in a part of the sky you can see. The words appear to be made of clouds and remain in place for the spell's duration, then dissipate when the spell ends. A strong wind can disperse the clouds and end the spell early.

## Sleep
*1st-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). 

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. 

A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total to be affected. Undead and creatures with charm immunity aren't affected.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.


## Sleet Storm
*3rd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  150 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a dust mote and water drop)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Until the spell ends, freezing sleet falls in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and puts out exposed flames in the area. The ground in the area is covered with ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the  area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.

If a creature starts its turn in the spell's area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.

## Slow
*3rd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a drop of molasses)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.

A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.



## Snare
*1st-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.

## Snow Swarm
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small white rock chip)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
A flurry of magic snow erupts from a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Soul Cage
*6th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 reaction, which you take when a humanoid you can see within 60 feet of you dies
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a tiny cage worth 100 ct)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the cage you use for the material component. The soul remains inside until the spell ends or until the cage is destroyed, which ends the spell. While a soul is inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. On the sixth use, it is released, and the spell ends. A soul cannot be revived until released.

***Steal Life.*** You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points.

***Query Soul.*** You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

***Borrow Experience.*** You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul’s life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don’t use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

***Eyes of the Dead.*** You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you’re currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). You receive visual auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.

A creature that can see the sensor (as with *see invisibility* or truesight) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

\column

## Spare the Dying
*Necromancy cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.



## Speak with Animals
*1st-level divination* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes
You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM's discretion.

## Speak with Dead
*3rd-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (burning incense)
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes
You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

## Speak with Plants
*3rd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (30-foot radius)
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes
You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

This spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.

## Spider Climb
*2nd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

\column

## Spike Growth
*2nd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  150 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (seven sharp thorns)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns, becoming difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize it as hazardous before entering it.

## Spirit Fire
*1st-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

## Spirit Guardians
*3rd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self (15-foot radius)
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a holy symbol)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. Their appearance is influenced both by the type of magic being used to summon them and your alignment. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature's speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

\page

## Spirit Shroud
*3rd-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You call forth spirits of the dead, which flit around you for the spell's duration. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable. Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals 1d8 extra damage when you hit a creature within 10 feet of you. This damage is radiant, necrotic, or cold (your choice when you cast the spell). Any creature that takes this damage can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

In addition, any creature of your choice that you can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.

## Spiritual Weapon
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics might make their weapon display traits of their chosen element, such as a hammer of stone or scything blades of wind. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd.

\column

## Staggering Smite
*4th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra 4d6 psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.


## Steel Wind Strike
*5th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish to strike like the wind. Choose up to five creatures you can see within range. Make a melee spell attack against each target. On a hit, a target takes 6d10 force damage.

You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you hit or missed.

## Stinking Cloud
*3rd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

## Stone Shape
*4th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.

## Stoneskin
*4th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour

\column

## Storm of Vengeance
*9th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Sight
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.

For each round you maintain concentration on this spell after the first, the storm produces different effects on your turn.

**Round 2.** Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.

**Round 3.** You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can't be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Round 4.** Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Round 5-10.** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud.

The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.

## Storm Sphere
*4th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  150 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.

Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases for each of its effects by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

## Suggestion
*2nd-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 8 hours
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a Templar give their coinpurse to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

You call forth an elemental spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Elemental Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature resembles a bipedal form wreathed in the chosen element, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

## Sunburst

Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.

**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a quiver containing at least one piece of ammunition)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.

## Sword Burst

**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You create a momentary circle of spectral blades that sweep around you. All other creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 force damage.

## Symbol
*7th-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled or triggered
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect children or Changelings). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

***Death.*** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

***Discord.*** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute.

During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

***Fear.*** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

***Hopelessness.*** Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.

***Insanity.*** Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.

***Pain.*** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.

***Sleep.*** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

***Stunning.*** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

## Synaptic Static
*5th-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw.  A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is immune.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the result from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can repeat the  saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



## Telekinesis
*5th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can create one of the effects below on one creature or object that you can see within range. You can affect the same target each round, or choose a new one. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

***Creature.*** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. On a success, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the spell's range. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air. On subsequent rounds, you can  repeat this check and attempt to maintain your hold on the target as an action.

***Object.*** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the spell's range. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the spell's range.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door, stowing or retrieving an item, or pouring the contents from a vial.

## Telepathic Bond
*5th-level divination* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell.

Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.

## Telepathy
*8th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Unlimited
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pair of linked silver rings)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
You create a telepathic link between yourself and a willing creature with which you are familiar. The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are no longer on the same plane.

Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words, images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with. The spell enables a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your words and take in the scope of any sensory messages you send to it.

## Teleport
*7th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to another destination. Teleported objects must be able to fit in a 10-foot cube, and can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. 


***Familiarity.*** "Permanent circle" means a permanent *teleportation circle* whose sigil sequence you know.

"Associated object" means you possess an object taken from the  destination in the last six months.

"Very familiar" is a place that you can see, have been to often, or have carefully studied. 

"Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.

"Viewed once" is a place you have seen once.

"Description" is a place whose location you know through a map or someone else's description. 

"False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

***On Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.

***Off Target.*** The target creatures (or object) appear a ways away from their intended destination. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction of the target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on. 

***Similar Area.*** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another Arcanist's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the same plane.

***Mishap.*** The spell's unpredictable magic causes each teleporting creature (or target object) to take 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where they wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

## Teleportation Circle
*5th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems worth 50 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: 1 round
As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

\column

## Tiny Servant
*3rd-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn’t attached to another object or a surface and isn’t being carried by another creature. The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. See the stat block for its statistics.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.

When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.

## Tongues
*3rd-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
This spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.

## Transmute Rock
*5th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (clay and water)
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You choose an area of stone or mud that you can see that fits within a 40-foot cube and is within range, and choose one of the following effects.

***Transmute Rock to Mud.*** Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell's duration.

The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.

If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Transmute Mud to Rock.*** Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface to an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A restrained creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

## Transport via Plants
*6th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  10 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 1 round
This spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence.

## Tree Stride
*5th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self

You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you're in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.

You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.

## True Polymorph
*9th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.

This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.

***Creature into Creature.*** If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and returns to the number of hit points it had before when it reverts back. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce its normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions. The target's gear melds into the new form, but it can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

***Object into Creature.*** You can turn an object into any creature CR 9 or lower, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and acts according to your instructions. It acts on each of your turns. The DM has its statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.

If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.

***Creature into Object.*** If you turn a creature into an object, everything it is wearing and carrying transforms with it as long as the object's size is no larger than the creature's. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.

## True Resurrection
*9th-level necromancy*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 hour
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a sprinkle of arcanic water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 ct, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.
This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.

The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

## True Seeing
*6th-level divination*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 ct; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Gray, all out to a range of 120 feet.

## True Strike
*Divination cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 round
You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target's defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn't ended.

## Tsunami
*8th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  Sight
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 6 rounds
A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much  on a successful save.

At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters  must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.

A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can’t move. A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground.

## Unseen Servant
*1st-level conjuration* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a string and a bit of wood)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a living servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

## Wall of Fire
*4th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The other side of the wall deals no damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

## Wall of Force
*5th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by *dispel magic*. A *disintegrate* spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Gray, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

\column

## Wall of Ice
*6th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.

## Wall of Light
*5th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a hand mirror)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A shimmering wall of bright light appears at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight, but creatures and objects can pass through it. It emits bright light out to 120 feet and dim light for an additional 120 feet.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. A blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

A creature that ends its turn in the wall’s area takes 4d8 radiant damage.

Until the spell ends, you can use an action to launch a beam of radiance from the wall at one creature you can see within 60 feet of it. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, reduce the length of the wall by 10 feet. If the wall's length drops to 0 feet, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

## Wall of Stone
*5th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a small block of granite)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness.

Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

## Wall of Thorns
*6th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a handful of thorns)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-
sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight. 

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

## Wall of Water
*3rd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a drop of water)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain.

Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.

\column

## Warding Bond
*2nd-level abjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Touch
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 ct each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.

## Warding Wind
*2nd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell's duration. The wind has the following effects:
* It deafens you and other creatures in its area.
* It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.
* It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
* The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.
* The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if they pass in or out of the wind.

## Warrior's Transformation
*6th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a few hairs from a bull)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic. Until the spell ends, you can't cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:
* You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.
* You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons. 
* When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra 2d12 force damage.
* You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons. 
* You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws. 
* You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.

Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

## Water Breathing
*3rd-level transmutation* (ritual)
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.

This spell may also be used to allow a character to breathe while submerged in silt. 

\column



## Watery Sphere
*4th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  90 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a droplet of water)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius on a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.

Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.

As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.

When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.

## Web
*2nd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area. If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.


## Weird
*9th-level illusion*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

\column

## Whirlwind
*7th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  300 feet
**Components:** ::  V, M (a piece of straw)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.

A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.

A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 × 10 feet away from it in a random direction.


## Wind Walk
*6th-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 minute
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (fire and arcanic water)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form.

Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.

If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

## Wind Wall
*3rd-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration. 

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gasses at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.

\column

## Wish
*9th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
*Wish* is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality.

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:
* You create one nonmagical object of up to 25,000 ct in value, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. The object's size can be no more than 300 feet.
* You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the *greater restoration* spell.
* You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
* You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single  magical effect for 8 hours. 
* You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. 

The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast *wish* ever again if you suffer this stress.

## Witch Bolt
*1st-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  30 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S, M (a twig from a tree that has been struck by lightning)
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.


## Word of Radiance
*Evocation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  5 feet
**Components:** ::  V, M (a holy symbol)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You utter a divine word, and burning radiance erupts from you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

\column

## Word of Recall
*6th-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  5 feet
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.

You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to an entity which grants you power. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn't dedicated to such a being, the spell has no effect.


## Wrath of Nature
*5th-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  120 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause. trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.

***Grasses and Undergrowth.*** Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.

***Trees.*** At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 slashing damage from whipping branches.

***Roots and Vines.*** At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

***Rocks.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone.

## Wrathful Smite
*1st-level evocation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.

## Zephyr Strike
*1st-level transmutation*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 bonus action
**Range:** ::  Self
**Components:** ::  V
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You move like the wind. Until the spell ends, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

Once before the spell ends, you can give yourself advantage on one weapon attack roll on your turn. That attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage on a hit. Whether you hit or miss, your walking speed increases by 30 feet until the end of that turn.

\column

## Zone of Truth
*2nd-level enchantment*
**Casting Time:** ::  1 action
**Range:** ::  60 feet
**Components:** ::  V, S
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

<div style='margin-top:52px;'></div>

Psionics are a daily part of life in Athas, and all living creatures will have some exposure to them. It is not uncommon to see a leatherworker using their wild talent to mold a hide, or a pickpocket telekinetically lifting coinpurses.  Even the beasts of the wastelands likely have some ability that improves their survivability. Every Sorcerer-King (and most merchant houses) keep a stable of powerful psionicists on staff, and in cities those who display a greater degree of power are carefully watched for signs of disloyalty. 


{{note
##### The Will and the Way
The "Will" is one's innate psionic ability, and the "Way" is the art of studying psionics. Each psionicist refers to themselves through their focus of study, such as Empath or Icon, and to the common folk, all are commonly called "mindbenders."
}}

All races accept and have some affinity for psionics. Even so, laws of the cities take into account psionic powers. Crimes committed by a psionically compelled person punish the psionicist rather than their puppet, and mind-reading is forbidden against all but slaves.

### Path of the Mindbender

When people learn to use psionics, they're taught to create a nexus-- a point in the center of their beings where physical, mental, and spiritual energy can be harnessed. It is the union of these powers that allows mindbenders to perform the remarkable feats they're capable of.

While many beings can discover the strength of the Will within themselves, most who go on to study the Way require guidance from a teacher. There are schools of the Way in every city of Athas, and merchant houses and noble families often pay dearly to have their scions educated by the best. 

Rarely, the academies waive tuition for a promising student of the free classes. Slaves are never formally instructed, though tenets of the Way often find ways to them regardless, particularly in the monastic traditions of the arenas.

In addition to the formal schools, there are wandering teachers or tribal elders who take it upon themselves to instruct those who show promise. Even field slaves may be instructed by an older, wiser slave in secret sessions. 

\column

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Most of these tutors can't provide the quality of training that a formal curriculum can, but some wandering masters are very capable and can provide an unrivaled education in the psionic arts. It is said there is even a secret order of mindbenders powerful enough to challenge a Sorcerer-King, though if such an Order exists, its agenda has yet to be known.


### A Rare Talent

Although thousands of Athasians command a unique wild talent, true masters of the Way are still rare. It takes exceptional ability and dedication to take up the study of the Way, and many do not progress far. Less than one person in
one hundred who formally study the Way can be considered a true mindbender.

Because trained psionicists are scarce, they are highly valued by many elements of Athasian society. Unlike spellcasters, psionicists are free of the taint of magic and need not disguise their calling. They owe no particular loyalty to the Sorcerer-Kings, unlike Crusaders or Templars. Even Clerics and Druids have elemental powers and guarded lands that they must place first. A psionicist is free to make their own way, their will bent only to the ruler they choose. 

Any psionicist willing to sell their services will find there is great demand for someone skilled in the mental arts. Merchant houses, psionic schools, nobles, and Templars routinely employ psionicists to help them against their enemies. In fact, it is unusual to encounter a psionicist who has no patron or employer. Such rogue agents are often seen as troublemakers.

{{note
##### Do Athasians Dream of Psionic Sheep?
Psionics have no external source and are a natural extension of a psionic creature itself. A psionicist owes their power to no other entity or source but the mind. Whenever a character uses a psionic power or ability, the matter and energy manifested is drawn from the psionic potential of the countless minds composing the world's collective unconscious, which exists in both the Material Plane and its shadow within the Gray. For more on the unique nature of Athas' planes, see Appendix A.

## The Basics of Psionics

Psionics, as a form of magic, have some similarities to spellcasting. There are two types of psionic powers: psionic talents and psionic augments.

Psionic talents are cantrips and are similar to arcane or elemental cantrips. Their primary distinction is that they have an indefinite duration that lasts for as long as you focus on them. You can only focus on one psionic talent at a time, and you only lose focus if you lose consciousness.

Psionic augments are powers that look like spells in most ways: they have schools of magic, they range from 1st to 9th level, and you can only use (or manifest) them a limited number of times between long rests. They are not spells, however, and rather than expending spell slots, you must expend psi points to manifest them. The number of psi points you have, and the limits of their use, typically depend on the number of level you have in a class that grants psionic powers.

Additionally, each augment is a psionic power that modifies or amplifies a specific psionic talent, and you can only manifest an augment while you are focusing on the talent it is keyed to.

Psionic classes are presented in Chapter 3, while Part 2 presents some examples of how psionic powers can be used during play. This section goes into the gritty details of psionics, from their different types to the mechanics of their use. 

#### Saving Throws
Many psionic powers specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a power’s effects. The power specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your powers equals 8 + your psionic ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

#### Attack Rolls
Some powers require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the psionic effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a power attack equals your psionic ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most powers that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated.

### Using a Psionic Talent
Talents are psionic powers that are also cantrip spells, and follow most of the normal rules for casting spells, such as casting time, range, and area of effect. There are three exceptions to this; as psionic powers, talents have different rules for their schools, spell components, and duration.

\column


#### Schools of Psionics
Scholars of psychic manifestations categorize psionic effects differently than spellcasters. The following psionic schools help describe psionic effects. These schools have no rules of their own, but other rules might refer to these new schools or to “psionic spells,” which are any spells that have a psionic school. A *detect magic* spell can determine a school of psionics as easily as a school of magic.

***Clairsentience.*** This school encompasses psionic effects that impart knowledge, enhance senses, or alter probability. Spells and abilities that defend against divination, such as *mind blank*, also provide protection from clairsentience powers.

***Metacreativity.*** Powers of this school typically draw thoughts into reality, shaping imagined things into matter.

***Psychokinesis.*** This school consists of effects that manifest energy or telekinetic force.

***Psychometabolism.*** Some psionic effects impose will over flesh, pushing living biology beyond its normal limits. Spells and abilities that defend against transmutation also provide protection from psychometabolism powers.

***Psychoportation.*** Psionic effects that move objects or creatures through time, space, and planes of existence belong to this school.

***Telepathy.*** Telepathic effects touch upon the minds of others, whether to communicate with them, influence their thoughts or perceptions, or barrage them with pure damaging psychic power.


#### Psionic Components
Most psionic talents do not have normal components (verbal, somatic, or material), as they are products entirely of the mind. However, the act of casting a psionic cantrip is oftentimes obvious to observers, and such psionic effects have the following components:

***Auditory (A).*** Some manner of noise audible to all within 60 feet accompanies the use of psionic powers with this component. Creatures within 30 feet can determine the origin of the sound as easily as if it were regular, clear speech.

***Observable (O).*** Some psionic powers come with a visible display when they manifest or are cast. The origin of such an effect can be visually traced back to its creator by creatures within line of sight.

#### Psionic Focus
All psionic talents have a duration of Focus. You can only focus on one effect at a time, and you may focus on an effect indefinitely while you remain conscious. Your focus ends if you are knocked unconscious, if you begin focusing on another spell or effect, or if the psionic talent you are focusing on is dispelled. You may also choose to stop focusing at any time, requiring no action.

### Manifesting Augments
Psionic powers that magnify the effects of psionic talents are called augments. Augments follow many of the same rules as spells: range, targets, areas of effect, saving throws, attack rolls, and combining magical effects all apply as described in Chapter 10. However psionic augments are not spells and have a few rules unique to them, described below.

#### Power Level
Each augment has a listed power level, ranging from 1 to 9. When you manifest an augment, it increases the power level of the talent it is augmenting to the augment’s power level. This increase begins when you initiate the manifesting time of the power, and lasts until the augment’s duration ends (augments with an instantaneous duration end immediately upon use).

As cantrips, unaugmented talents have a power level of 0 and their power level is only increased by augments you manifest while you focus on them. If your focus on a talent ends but the duration of an augment continues, the talent does not automatically gain the increased power level if you cast it again before the augment’s duration ends.

Augments aren’t spells, but the effects of augments with non-instantaneous durations can be ended early with *dispel magic* by dispelling the talent they are augmenting at its augmented power level. An augment that is manifested without focusing on a talent, such as one cast by a magic item, has a spell level equal to its power level for the purpose of adjudicating *dispel magic*.

#### School
Augments have the same schools of psionics that talents do. Most augments are of the same school as the talent they modify, but some augments change the school of the  talent they augment for the duration of their effects.

#### Augmenting
Each augment’s entry specifies which talent you must currently be focusing on in order to manifest it. You cannot manifest an augment for one talent while you are focusing on a different talent.

#### Psi Cost
Manifesting psionic powers does not expend spell slots. Instead, in order to augment a psionic talent, you must possess a reserve of potential psionic energy and expend a portion of it. This energy is represented by psi points. Casting a psionic talent cantrip does not expend psi points, but manifesting an augment does. Each psionic augment specifies the minimum number of psi points you must expend in order to manifest it.

The number of psi points available to you usually depends on your character level and your class or subclass. Your number of psi points can’t go below 0, or over your maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest.

\column



You may spend psi points you have on any augments you know, regardless of their source or whether they are normally manifested through the expenditure of psi points.

***Psi Limit.*** The number of psi points you can spend on a single manifestation of a power is limited. This limit usually depends on your character level, class, and subclass. Other options such as race or feats might specify a psi limit as well. Your psi limit for psionic effects you know is always the highest psi limit you have, regardless of source, unless that source is specifically limited to certain effects. You cannot manifest powers whose psi cost is greater than your limit.

***Intensify.*** The listed psi cost for all augments is a minimum. You can choose to spend more psi points than an augment’s minimum cost up to your limit, increasing the augment’s power level by 1 for every 2 psi points beyond the minimum you spend.

When a power’s description includes a specific intensify option, it states the effects of spending additional psi points on the power in addition to increasing its power level. Points spent to intensify a power count towards your psi limit. 

#### Manifesting Time
Manifesting an augment requires the same kind of actions that casting a spell might (actions, bonus actions, reactions, etc.), but it is not casting a spell. Rules that refer to casting or casting times do not apply to the manifesting of psionic augments.

***Powers and Spells.*** Manifesting an augment and casting a spell are two different ways of creating magical effects that are mutually exclusive of one another. You cannot cast a non-psionic spell and manifest an augment in the same turn.

In addition, if you manifest an augment as a bonus action, the only psionic powers that can be used are talents with a casting time of 1 action.

***Reactions.*** Several psionic augments have manifesting times of 1 reaction, but no accompanying trigger. You may use your reaction to manifest these augments at any time you wish, as long as you are focusing on the appropriate talent. If timing isn’t specified, you can only react to a creature's action after it happens. As normal, you regain your reaction at the start of your next turn.

#### Components
Manifesting an augment on a psionic talent does not usually require material, somatic, or verbal components, but some psionic talents require auditory (A) or observable (O) components, which make it obvious that you're manifesting a power. 

#### Duration
Psionic powers have the same kinds of durations as spells do. A talent being augmented by a power that has a set duration inherits the duration of that augment, but augments with a duration of concentration don't end if your focus on the augmented talent ends.

This chapter describes the powers available to psionicists in the world of DARK SUN. The chapter begins with an alphabetical list of all psionic talents with the classes (or subclasses) that have access to them. Below each talent, the powers that augment them are listed by power level. These lists are called Power Trees.

The remainder of the chapter contains power descriptions, divided into two sections. The first section contains the descriptions of psionic talents, and the second section lists the descriptions of psionic augments.

## Aura Beacon
*Metacreativity cantrip*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:**        :: Self (40-foot radius)
**Components:**   :: O
**Duration:**     :: Focus
 You visibly manifest your aura. While you focus, a bright light radiates from your body. When you cast this spell, and as a bonus action while you continue to focus on it, you may modulate the radius of the aura’s light, from as short as 1 inch, to as long as 20 feet. Regardless of the length of this radius of bright light, a radius of dim light of equal length extends out from the bright light. Your aura’s light can be colored as you like.


## Autonomous Vitality
*Psychometabolism cantrip*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:**        :: Self (60-foot radius)
**Components:**   :: A
**Duration:**     :: Focus
You amplify the sound of your heartbeat, radiating your own vitality outward and syncing your allies to your lifeforce. Until your focus ends, when a creature within range rolls to stabilize after reaching 0 hit points and falling unconscious, you can use your reaction to provide that creature with advantage on that saving throw.

## Battle Trance
*Psychometabolism cantrip*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: A
**Duration:**     :: Focus
You optimize your body for combat. Until your focus ends, any attack roll you make for a melee weapon attack ignores disadvantage. If disadvantage would normally apply to the roll, that roll also can’t benefit from advantage.

\column

::
## Blind Spot
*Telepathy cantrip*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: None
**Duration:**     :: Focus
While you focus on this power, you can use your action to try to erase notice of yourself from a creature you can see in range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you are invisible to it until the end of your next turn or until you take an action. If you take an action, your invisibility ends before your action.

## Ectoplasmic Object
*Metacreativity cantrip*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Components:**   :: A, O
**Duration:**     :: Focus
You pull matter from the Gray to create objects you imagine on your own plane.

While you focus, you may use your action to create a fragile, Tiny object that lasts for 1 minute, or until you dismiss it as an action, create a new object with this power, or until the object is destroyed. When the object is destroyed, you dismiss it, or its time expires, it dissolves into ectoplasmic slime that evaporates into nothing.

The object you create is translucent, with a crystalline, glassy, or slimy appearance as you desire. It has an AC of 5, 1 hit point, and must be able to fit in a 1-foot cube. The object can take whatever form you desire, but is simple with no internal mechanisms. It can have the outward appearance of a complex object, such as a crossbow or clockwork device, but it does not function. The object cannot serve as a tool, weapon, or other useful piece of equipment.

## Energy Ray
*Psychokinesis cantrip*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Focus

You hold your hand aloft and generate a font of pure energy within it. When you cast this spell, choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

Until your focus ends, you can use your action to target one creature within range and shoot a ray of energy at it. Make a ranged power attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage of the type you chose when you cast this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** This power allows you to shoot more than one ray as an action when you reach higher levels: two rays at 5th level, three rays at 11th level, and four rays at 17th level. You can direct the rays at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each ray.

## Imbue Psicrystal
*Metacreativity cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::Touch
**Components:** ::O, M (a small crystal worth 10ct)
**Duration:** ::Focus
You hold a crystal aloft and imbue it with a shard of sentience and energy drawn from the Gray, transforming it into a psicrystal. The psicrystal floats off your hand and into your space.

The psicrystal is a Tiny construct with an AC equal to your power save DC, hit points equal to your psionic ability modifier, and a fly speed of 30 feet that allows it to hover. All of its ability scores are 10, and it has no proficiencies. It cannot be poisoned, and is immune to poison damage and disease. The psicrystal can see and hear as well as an average humanoid, except that it is blind to everything more than 30 feet from it.

When the psicrystal drops to 0 hit points, or when the power ends, it becomes a nonmagical crystal. You may reuse the same crystal to cast this spell again. When you do, the psicrystal you create retains the memories it had from any time it spent as a psicrystal from previous castings.

The psicrystal is friendly to you and your companions. You can communicate with it telepathically out to a range of 100 feet. It acts on the same initiative count as you, immediately after your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to mentally or verbally command it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help actions. The psicrystal cannot make any attacks.

\column

## Inertial Transference
*Psychoportation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::Self (30-foot radius)
**Components:** ::A
**Duration:** ::Focus
You store your potential momentum and impart it onto your allies. While you focus on this power, when you end your turn without having used any of your movement during it, you can use your reaction to move one willing creature you can see within range up to half their speed, following a path of your choice. To move this way, the ally mustn’t be incapacitated.


## Mind Thrust
*Telepathy cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::60 feet
**Components:** ::O
**Duration:** ::Focus
While you focus on this power, you can use your action to target one creature you can see within range, making your eyes flare noticeably for an instant. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d10 points of psychic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** This cantrip’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).


## Mindblade
*Metacreativity cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action 
**Range:** ::Self
**Components:** ::O 
**Duration:** ::Focus
You create a weapon of solidified thoughts, called a mindblade. It is a magical melee weapon you are proficient with that deals 1d8 piercing or slashing damage, as decided by you when you create it. You may choose to use your psionic ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using your mindblade.

Until your focus ends, you cannot let go of your mindblade, nor can it be forced from your grip, unless an effect specifically says otherwise. When your focus on this power ends, your mindblade disappears.




{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Mindlink
*Telepathy cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::120 feet
**Components:** ::A
**Duration:** ::Focus
You contact the mind of another creature you can see within range, granting you the ability to communicate with it telepathically while you focus on this power. While you focus, the target can telepathically communicate with you as well. If you don’t share a language with the target, you can convey emotions and feelings, but can’t engage in complex conversation. The target must have an Intelligence of at least 4, otherwise this spell fails and the casting time is wasted. You can only communicate with the target while it remains in range.

Until your focus ends, you can use a bonus action to switch the target of this spell to another creature you can see within range. The spell ends if the new target does not have an Intelligence of at least 4.

## Mystic Displacement
*Psychoportation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::30-foot radius
**Components:** ::A
**Duration:** ::Focus
With an audible thrum, you extend your senses out around you, reaching through the fold of space to manipulate objects.

Until your focus ends, you can use your action to teleport a loose object you can see within 30 feet of you to another location within range. The object can’t weigh more than 10 pounds, and you can’t affect an object being worn or carried by another creature. When the item reappears, it can be in any orientation you desire relative to its original one. The object falls if you cause it to reappear in midair.

\column

## Primal Metabolism
*Psychometabolism cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::Self (10 feet)
**Components:** ::None
**Duration:** ::Focus
You alter your body chemistry to produce volatile enzymes. 

Until your focus ends, you can use an action to expel a visible cloud of poisonous or acidic vapor at one creature within range, or two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or take 1d6 acid or poison damage (your choice).

***At Higher Levels.*** This cantrip’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).


## Psychic Hammer
*Psychokinesis cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::30 feet
**Components:** ::O
**Duration:** ::Focus
While you focus on this power, you can use your action to target one creature you can see within range with a battering ram of translucent telekinetic energy. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 points of force damage and be knocked prone.

***At Higher Levels.*** This cantrip’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).


## Psychic Static
*Telepathy cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::60 feet
**Components:** ::A
**Duration:** ::Focus
When you cast this spell, you generate a field of subtle mental noise. Until your focus ends, you can make this noise perceivable by any number of creatures you can see in range at any time, requiring no action. Creatures who can sense this effect know it originates from your direction.

Whenever a creature you can see that perceives this noise makes an ability check, you may use your reaction to force the creature to roll a d4 and subtract the result from the check. Deafened creatures are not immune to this effect.

## Sixth Sense
*Clairstentience cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::Self
**Components:** ::None
**Duration:** ::Focus
You gain a prescient sense that improves your reflexive response to danger, granting you advantage on initiative rolls until your focus ends.


## Speed of Thought
*Psychoportation cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::Self
**Components:** ::O
**Duration:** ::Focus
Your body’s responses to your thoughts quicken, increasing your walking speed by 10 feet until your focus ends.

Additionally, while you focus, you may teleport to your feet from a prone position once per round on your turn, requiring no action and expending none of your movement. Your speed must not be 0 for you to teleport this way.


## True Shot
*Clairsentience cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::Self
**Components:** ::O 
**Duration:** ::Focus
One of your eyes turns a lusterless black, granting you unparalleled concentration in aiming your ranged attacks.

Until your focus ends, any attack roll you make for a ranged weapon attack ignores disadvantage. If disadvantage would normally apply to the roll, that roll also can’t benefit from advantage.

## Verve
*Psychometabolism cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::Self
**Components:** ::A, O 
**Duration:** ::Focus
When you cast this spell, you are energized and briefly glow as you intone a low hum that reverberates through your body.

Until your focus ends, you don’t need to eat, breathe, or sleep. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend 8 hours engaged in light activity.


## Wild Technique
*Metacreativity cantrip*
**Casting Time:** ::1 bonus action
**Range:** ::10 feet
**Components:** ::A, O
**Duration:** ::Focus
You manifest minor psionic effects. Until your focus ends, you can create one of the following effects as an action:

***Far Hand.*** You telekinetically manipulate up to five unattended objects within range, simultaneously moving them to another location within range in any orientation you desire. You can only affect up to 5 pounds of matter at once.

***Dislocate Vision.*** You shift your field of vision to one that originates from any point you can see within range. This point moves relative to you as you move. While your vision is dislocated, your eyes glow with light. This effect lasts as long as you focus, or you use this effect again to return your vision to normal.

***Subjective Sense.*** You telepathically cause all creatures within range to experience a simple sensation that is subjective to each, such as “the scent of my favorite food.” This sensation lasts for 1 minute or until you use this effect again, and affected creatures know it is not real. When you use this effect, you must specify which sense will be affected: sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch. Creatures continue to perceive their real surroundings even while subject to this effect, and do not suffer any detriment or receive any benefit due to the subjective sensation they perceive. You gain no knowledge of specifically what a creature senses due to this effect.

**Manifesting Time:** ::1 reaction
**Range:** ::Self
**Components:** ::O
**Duration:** ::instantaneous
When you are hit by an attack, you can instantly transmogrify the outer layer of your skin into a dense metamaterial that absorbs the impact before flaking away. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. This bonus applies against the triggering attack.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the bonus to AC increases by 1 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

**Augmenting:** ::*mindlink* 
**Psi Cost:** ::5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** ::1 action
**Range:** ::Self
**Components:** ::O
**Duration:** ::Concentration, up to 1 minute
When you manifest this augment, you target one creature you are telepathically communicating with and cause their instinctual fight-or-flight terror response to go haywire. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d6 psychic damage and considers all other creatures to be life-threatening and hostile to it. Until your concentration ends, it takes 1d6 psychic damage for every other creature within 5 feet of it at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target takes only half the initial damage and suffers no other effect. A creature is immune to this power if it is immune to being frightened.

**Psi Cost:** ::5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** ::1 action
**Range:** ::30 feet
**Components:** ::A
**Duration:** ::Concentration, up to 1 minute
You transfer a creature’s future inertial potential into its present form. Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. For as long as you concentrate, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

When the augment’s duration ends, the target is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 until the end of its next turn, as it experiences the future from which all its inertial potential was borrowed.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 8 extra psi points to manifest this augment, you manifest it as a 7th-level power, and you may affect up to five willing creatures you can see within range instead of one.

Additionally, whenever you are targeted by or are in the area of a spell or power of 5th level or lower, all creatures inside your affinity field are treated as though they were targeted or were in the area of the same effect, receiving their own saving throws if applicable. The effects of non-instantaneous spells or powers transferred to targets this way end when the affinity field ends, regardless of whether the spell or power’s normal duration is longer.

## Anger Impulse

**Augmenting:** ::*mindlink*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You coerce the inner id lurking in the mind of another creature to unleash itself, sending it into a reckless fury. One creature you are telepathically communicating with must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d8 psychic damage, and the only action it can take on its next turn is the Attack action. If the target chooses to take the Attack action on its turn, it makes all of its attacks on that turn with advantage, but all attacks against the target of this power have advantage until the start of its next turn.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and it experiences no additional effects.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you may target 1 additional creature you can see within range for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

**Augmenting:** :: *verve*
**Psi Cost:** :: 9 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You touch a creature and assimilate their life force and matter into your body. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7d6 + 20 force damage and you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is completely assimilated.

A completely assimilated creature dies and its entire body, including everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, is broken down and absorbed entirely into your body. The creature can be restored to life only by means of *true resurrection*, *reality revision*, or similar magic.

When you completely assimilate a creature, your hit point maximum increases by 2 for every hit die the target creature possessed. Additionally, you gain a semblance of the creature’s form, granting you advantage on ability checks to impersonate it. Both of these effects last until you finish a long rest.

This power has no effect on undead or constructs.

Starting with the creature that has the lowest hit point maximum, each creature affected by this option is charmed by you for the duration, regarding you as a friendly acquaintance. Subtract each creature’s hit point maximum from the total before moving onto the next creature. A creature’s hit point maximum must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

You imbue one ranged weapon you hold with psionic energy. The next attack you make with it that hits before the end of the current turn deals an extra 1d10 psychic damage.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d10 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.



## Chastise Scryers
*6th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *blind spot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 11 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
You enfold yourself in an invisible, protective barrier against magic eyes, projections, or sensors that attempt to view you or your surrounding area (for example, the effects created by *arcane eye*, *clairvoyance*, *scrying*, or *thought projection*). For the duration, whenever any such effect would be able to sense you, the creator of the effect must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage and cannot perceive you with the triggering effect. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and the triggering effect functions normally.

Regardless of a target’s success or failure, you are aware if someone triggers your trap. However, you do not gain any further information on the effect or its creator, such as the location of the sensor, eye, or projection, or whether the target succeeded or failed on their saving throw.

**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 120 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
With a sharp crack, you instantly and drastically lower the ambient temperature around one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 cold damage and has its speed halved until your concentration ends. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and it suffers no further effect. A target that has its speed reduced by this augment can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d8 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

**Augmenting:** :: *mindlink*
**Psi Cost:** :: 2 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 30 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You ask a question of one creature that can see and hear you within range, your voice reverberating with unnatural gravitas. The question must be phrased so that it can be answered with a yes or no, otherwise the power fails. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it replies with a truthful answer.

A creature is immune to this effect if it does not share a language with you or if it is immune to being charmed.

**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You stoke the rage of a creature you can see within range, causing it to attack relentlessly with no thought for its own safety. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, whenever the target makes a melee attack while you concentrate, any creature within 5 feet of the target can use a reaction to make a melee attack against it. The target automatically fails the saving throw if it is using a feature or ability that allows it to benefit from strong emotions of aggression, rage, fury, or similar states of mind (as determined by the DM).

**Augmenting:** :: *mindlink*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: Unlimited
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You form a telepathic connection to a creature familiar to you. The target must have an Intelligence of at least 2, otherwise this power fails and the manifesting time and psi cost are wasted. If the target knows you, it recognizes your mind touching its own as you form this connection. While you concentrate, you may telepathically communicate twenty-five words or less to the target as an action. Until your concentration ends, the target may also telepathically communicate up to twenty-five words to you as an action. You and the target can understand this telepathic communication, even if you don’t share a language.

You can establish this telepathic connection across any distance and it may even reach across to other planes of existence.

## Covetous Urge
*4th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *blind spot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You reach into the mind of a creature you can see within range, and make it believe the object of its deepest desires appears before it. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you gain partial control over the target’s behavior for the duration of this power. On its turn, you determine the target’s movement, as the target pursues the phantom object it covets. If the target has taken damage since the end of its last turn, it can act normally, otherwise it can only use its action to admire this phantom object. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being charmed.



## Crisis of Breath
*3rd-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *blind spot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You reach into the mind of a creature you can see within range, and make it believe it cannot breathe normally. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target exhales all breath it has in its lungs and begins suffocating. A suffocating creature can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round), and at the start of its next turn it drops to 0 hit points and is dying. On each of its turns for the duration, the target can use its action to manually gasp for breath, extending the number of rounds it can survive while suffocating by 1. If a creature forgoes gasping for breath to take other actions, it may act normally except that it cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.

If the target succumbs to suffocation and begins dying, it can be healed above 0 hit points, but in order to remain conscious, it must continue to manually gasp for air as an action each turn for the duration.

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being charmed or does not need to breathe.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 8 extra psi points to manifest this augment, you manifest it as a 7th-level power, and you may affect up to four creatures you can see within range instead of one.

## Crisis of Life
*8th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *blind spot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 15 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You reach into the mind of a creature you can see within range, and instill the belief that it is suffering from an immediate, deadly malady such as a catastrophic heart attack. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target utterly believes the condition is real and is knocked unconscious and begins dying. 

The target’s current hit point total is not reduced to 0, but for the duration, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If the target accrues three failures on these saving throws, it immediately dies, ignoring Vitality and Death Points rules. If the target accrues three successful saving throws, it stabilizes but remains unconscious for the duration. 

If the target rolls a natural 1 on this saving throw, it accumulates two failures instead of one. Additionally, 
if the target's hit points are reduced to 0 while unconscious in this manner and it takes any further damage, it automatically accumulates another failure. 

For the duration, magical or mundane healing and assistance cannot allow the target to return consciousness or stabilize it.

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being charmed.

## Crush Psyche
*7th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *mind thrust*
**Psi Cost:** :: 13 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You brutally crush the mind of one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw, taking 8d12 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the psychic damage it took. Any affect that imparts immunity to psychic damage allows a creature’s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d12 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

At least one 10-foot-long section of the wall must be within range when you manifest this power. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 12 and 30 hit points.

The air before you crackles as you strip heat from a 30-foot-by-30 foot cube originating from you. Any creature in the area when you manifest this augment and any creature that ends its turn there for the duration takes 5 cold damage.

Additionally, the ground in the area becomes difficult terrain for the duration, and any creature that moves more than 10 feet on this difficult terrain must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If the surface is sloped, a creature that falls prone in the area immediately slides to the bottom of the slope.

## Death Urge
*6th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *mindlink*
**Psi Cost:** :: 11 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: 1 round
You slip an artificial, self-destructive instinct into the mind of one creature you are telepathically communicating with. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is affected. On its next turn, an affected target attempts to end its life by the most direct means possible. If the target is armed, it takes the Attack action to make attacks against itself, all of which automatically hit and are critical hits. The target may repeat the saving throw after each attack, ending this power’s effects on a success.

If the target is unarmed, it moves as far as it can, including taking the Dash action if necessary, to its nearest enemy and lowers its guard, provoking an opportunity attack.

At the DM’s option, an affected target that perceives an immediately lethal hazard in the environment may subject itself to that hazard, such as flinging itself off a high cliff or diving into a lake of lava. In such cases, the affected creature moves as close as it can to the hazard without subjecting itself to it, taking the Dash action and provoking opportunity attacks if necessary, and then repeats the saving throw. On a success, this power’s effects end before the target subjects itself to the hazard. On a failure, the affected target uses its remaining movement to subject itself to the hazard.

You leach the inertia from one creature you can see within range, making it appear to move in a slower frame of reference. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by this augment for the duration.

An affected target’s speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature falls while affected by this augment, it falls only 60 feet a round until the effect ends, and it if it lands before the effect ends it takes no falling damage.

A creature affected by this power makes another Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you may target one additional creature within range for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

You focus ominously on a creature you can see within range and attempt to remove parts of its brain. Roll 15d8. If the total you roll equals or exceeds the target’s current hit point total, you instantly reduce its Intelligence score to 0 and teleport a large portion of its brain out of its body to a space within range. 

An affected creature is permanently incapacitated and cannot move or speak. It becomes limp and unresponsive to all outside stimuli. If not provided with care, an affected creature will perish in 3 days. These effects end on the target if its Intelligence score is restored.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you roll an extra 1d8 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost and add it to this augment’s total.

You touch a creature and show them all possible futures, inundating them with more terrible knowledge than they can bear. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 5d8 psychic damage and is stunned for the duration. On a success, the target takes half damage and is not stunned. A stunned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, and is no longer stunned on a success.

You briefly befuddle the senses and perception of one creature you can see within range, making it repeat itself. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, it repeats the action or actions it took on its previous turn. If conditions have changed enough to prevent the creature from taking the same actions again (if the creature it took the Attack action against last round is dead or out of range, if it no longer has the psi points necessary to manifest the augment at the same intensity it previously did, etc.), the target is instead incapacitated and doesn’t move until the beginning of your next turn.

**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You meditate on the location of one creature. In order to target a  creature with this augment, you must have seen the creature first-hand or have received a first-hand description or likeness of them. A disguise, whether mundane or magical, foils this power if you have not seen past the disguise first-hand. If you have a valid target, you gain an understanding of where the target is in the cosmos. You learn the region, city, town, village, and district where it is, pinpointing an area between 1 and 3 miles on a side (DM’s choice). If the creature is on another plane of existence, you instead learn which plane.

You may target yourself with this power, learning where you are (useful if you find yourself lost or unexpectedly transported). If you target yourself, you also gain the knowledge of which plane of existence you are currently on.

You subtly attune your vision to detect the presence of invisible magic eyes, projections, or sensors that might be viewing the area (for example, the effects created by *arcane eye, clairvoyance, scrying*, or *thought projection*). You recognize whether the effect is an eye, sensor, or projection, but gain no further knowledge about it (such as the effect that created it, or who created it). The creator of the effect does not inherently know that you have detected it, but may realize you have depending on your actions after discovering it.

You transmogrify yourself, including all equipment you are wearing, into a generally humanoid mass of translucent, wriggling ectoplasm. For the duration, you are immune to poison and nonmagical bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage; you cannot be poisoned; critical hits scored against you become normal hits; and your AC becomes 13 + your psionic ability modifier.

While in this form, you cannot take the Attack, Dash, or Use an Object actions. You can fly with a speed of 20 feet and can hover, and you can move through any gap that air can pass through without squeezing. You cannot enter water or other liquids, and you automatically fail saving throws to resist effects that create strong winds.

For the duration, you may only cast spells or manifest psionic powers that have no somatic, verbal, or material components. To successfully cast such a spell or manifest such a power, you must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the casting or manifesting time is wasted, but spell slots or psi points are not.

If you manifest this power on a construct or undead creature instead of an object, the creature regains 1d8 hit points. This power has no effect on any other kind of creature.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment on a construct or undead creature, the amount of hit points the creature regains increases by 1d8 for every additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment on an object, it can repair 1 additional cubic foot of matter for every additional psi point spend beyond the minimum cost.

## Ego Whip

**Augmenting:** :: *mind thrust*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You form your thoughts into a briefly perceptible whip of telepathic energy, and strike the mind of one creature you can see within range, forcefully imposing a sudden and intense feeling of self-doubt in it. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 psychic damage, and it can only take the Dodge, Disengage, or Hide actions on its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half as much damage, and its choice of action is not limited by this power.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you may target 1 additional creature you can see within range for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

**Augmenting:** :: *psychic static*
**Psi Cost:** :: 2 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 30 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You coalesce your telepathic field into a generalized positive disposition and implant it into one humanoid creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the power ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the power ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you may intensify it in one or both of the following ways, but points spent toward one method do not apply to the other.

You may target one additional humanoid creature for every 2 additional psi points spend beyond the minimum cost.

If you spend 6 additional psi points, you may target any kind of creature within range, instead of humanoids only.

## Empathic Shield
*1st-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *psychic static*
**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You target a creature you can see within range and cloak them in psychically imposed sympathy toward you. At the start of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is unable to harm you with an attack or effect until the start of its next turn, forcing it to target other creatures and place areas of effect carefully to avoid you. On a success, this  power’s effect ends on the target. If you take any violent action against the target, such as attacking it or affecting it with a harmful power or spell, the effect on the target immediately ends.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you may target 1 additional creature you can see within range for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You or a creature you touch gains resistance to cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice) for the duration.

**Augmenting:** :: *mindblade*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You transform your mindblade into a semi-solid state of energy. The next attack you make with your mindblade before the end of your next turn ignores the target’s armor, requiring no attack roll. Instead, the target makes a Dexterity saving throw against your power save DC. On a failed save, the target takes the attack’s damage and effects as if you successfully hit it with a melee attack. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage you would have inflicted, as if you successfully hit it with a melee attack, but suffers no additional effects (if any).

## Ensnaring Ennui
*2nd-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *psychic static*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You spend the manifesting time of this augment conversing with one creature you can see within range. If the target converses with you for the full manifesting time, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you insidiously infect it with a sense of overwhelming boredom. At the start of its next turn, the target sits down (becoming prone) and is incapacitated for the duration. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.

This effect ends immediately if the target or any of its allies it can see are attacked or take damage. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected, with no knowledge of your attempt to ensnare its will.

**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You cause a creature in range to perceive you as a subjectively frightening memory. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for the duration. Whenever the frightened target ends its turn in a location where it can’t see you, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. You gain no knowledge of the specific memory triggered in the target.

## Fighting Words
*2nd-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *psychic static*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You spend the manifesting time of this augment conversing with one creature you can see within range. If the target converses with you for the full manifesting time, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you insert in the target’s mind the urge to do violence against one creature you name or describe to it. 

If the target sees that creature before the duration ends, it attacks the creature. If the target was already hostile towards the creature, it attacks using weapons or magic. If the target is urged to attack a creature it was neutral or friendly towards, it will use unarmed strikes. Once the target attacks, it continues to do so for 1 minute, at which point this power ends. 

This augment immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage from any creature other than the one it has been incited against. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected, and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.

## Fortify Psicrystal

**Augmenting:** :: *imbue psicrystal*
**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action

**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: 8 hours
You touch your psicrystal and reinforce its crystalline lattice, strengthening its ability to weather harm. Your psicrystal’s maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration. This power ends early if your focus on *imbue psicrystal* ends.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you increase your psicrystal’s current and maximum hit points by an extra 5 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Fusion
*8th-level psychometabolism*
**Augmenting:** :: *verve*
**Psi Cost:** :: 15 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You and one willing Medium or smaller humanoid you touch fuse together into one creature (you cannot fuse with an already fused creature). The fused creature is a Medium humanoid that replaces you in your space. It has two actions each round, but one action can only involve purely mental activity, such as casting a spell with no components or manifesting a psionic power. You control all of the fused creature’s actions, but you can relinquish control to the other creature comprising the fused being at any time without using an action. If you relinquish control of the fused being, you cannot regain it until the other creature relinquishes it back to you.

The fused creature’s current and maximum hit point total is equal to the sum of both creature’s respective hit point totals. It has access to all racial and class features of both creatures (including proficiencies, spell slots available, psi point reserves, spells prepared, cantrips, spells and augments known, etc.). The fused creature uses the higher of either creature’s bonuses for any given attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, and has the higher of either creature’s score in every ability score.

When the fused creature comes into being, you decide what equipment you and the other creature are wearing is subsumed into the fused creature’s form, and what equipment remains usable. The fused creature has a regular humanoid body plan, so it can only accommodate as much gear as a normal humanoid could (one set of armor, two hands to hold or wield items, etc.)

When the power ends, the fused creature separates back into you and the original creature you touched. The other creature appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to yours. If no unoccupied space is available, the creature is immediately shunted to the nearest space that it can occupy and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it is moved.

When you and the original creature separate, you share the amount of damage inflicted on the fused being between you, as well as expended resources, such as psi points spent or spell slots used (subtracting evenly from both creatures if they share the same resources, or completely from one creature if it is the only one with such a resource).

If a fused creature is killed, it separates back into you and the original creature, both of whom are at 0 hit points, but alive and stable.

## Genesis
*8th-level metacreativity*
**Augmenting:** :: *aura beacon*
**Psi Cost:** :: 15 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
The first time you manifest this power, you initiate a process that propagates the creation of a demiplane. This propagation takes 120 days to complete, and if you manifest *genesis* again before then, the nascent demiplane collapses and a new process begins from scratch.

The environmental features of your demiplane (temperature, weather, flora, fauna, terrain, etc.) are chosen by you when you first begin its propagation and can range from a hostile, barren wasteland to a self-sustaining idyllic paradise. Your demiplane’s created environment cannot include precious minerals, gems, or special materials, and the only native life your demiplane can be created with are beasts of CR 1 or lower and inanimate plants. Your demiplane can be any shape you desire, but it cannot exceed 2 miles in any one dimension. Your demiplane does not contain structures, but buildings can be built there afterward.

Once the creation of your demiplane is complete, it comes into existence within the Gray. Thereafter, whenever you manifest *genesis* again, you create a pair of shimmering linked portals of light, one appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see, and the other appearing anywhere on your demiplane that you choose. Both portals are 5 feet wide and 10 feet high, are vertically oriented, and must rest on the ground. Each portal has a front and back, and travel through is possible only by moving through a portal’s front. Anything that does so is instantly transported, exiting the linked portal on the other side. The portals last for 1 hour, then vanish.

If you are familiar with another creature’s demiplane created by *genesis* or the *demiplane* spell, you can have the portal you create with either 

\column

::::::::::::

of those effects connect to the other creature’s demiplane instead of yours. Likewise, another creature that is familiar with your demiplane can connect to it if they manifest *genesis* or cast *demiplane*.

If you manifest *genesis* while already located within your demiplane, you produce one of the following effects:

***Receive.*** You may designate one unoccupied space touching the ground that you can see and begin concentrating (as though concentrating on a power) for 1 minute. If you maintain your concentration and remain within line of sight of the designated space for the entire minute, that surface becomes mystically attuned to receive incoming portals. Thereafter, whenever *genesis* or the *demiplane* spell is used by a creature other than you to travel to your demiplane, its portal or doorway appears in the designated space.

***Return.*** If the portals you used to travel to your demiplane have vanished, you may manifest *genesis* this way to re-open them. The portals appear in the same spaces they previously did if those spaces are currently unoccupied, or in the closest available unoccupied space if not.

***Destroy.*** You cause your demiplane to begin imploding in on itself, shrinking until completely annihilated 24 hours later. All creatures and nonmagical objects inside your demiplane are killed and destroyed if they remain in your demiplane when it is annihilated, leaving no remains. Magic items are scattered to random locations in the multiverse.

You cannot halt the implosion process once started, but after your demiplane is annihilated, you may manifest *genesis* again to begin propagating a new demiplane.

**Augmenting:** :: *inertial transference*
**Psi Cost:** :: 6 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You suspend gravity around you and seize control of the angular velocity of your inertia. For the duration, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you may affect one additional creature within 30 feet of you for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost. Affected creatures gain a flying speed of 60 feet for as long as you concentrate.

## Gravitic Spike

**Psi Cost:** :: 9 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 100 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You intensely magnify the acceleration of gravity in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Creatures who take falling damage in the area suffer an extra 1d12 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they fall. A creature’s walking speed is reduced to 5 feet in the area, and when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half of this damage.

In addition to the above effects, flying creatures who are in the area when you manifest this power, or who fly into the area, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature crashes, falling to the ground. On a success, the creature may use its remaining flying speed to exit the area, and its altitude is halved. If it cannot exit the area with this movement, it falls as if it failed the saving throw.

**Augmenting:** :: *blind spot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You cause one creature you can see within range to believe a threatening enemy stalks it, just out of sight. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 psychic damage, and—until the end of your next turn—melee attack rolls against it have advantage and it can’t use reactions. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and suffers no other effects. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being frightened.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d8 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Harness Hostility

**Psi Cost:** :: 2 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:** :: Self (5-foot radius)
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You extend your battle awareness outward to the minds of foes near you, and steer their enmity towards yourself. While you concentrate, any enemy within range that makes a melee attack roll against a creature other than you does so with disadvantage. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, this augment’s range extends by 5 feet for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

If you spend at least 4 additional psi points to extend this augment’s range, its effects also apply to ranged attacks that affected creatures make against creatures other than you.

**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You make a series of astounding deductions, putting together clues, inferences, and logical conclusions from disparate minutiae, possibly even pulling knowledge directly from the collective unconscious of all living creatures. When you manifest this power, you may answer up to five questions you pose to the DM on any topic. The DM provides the answers that you deduce, and must give accurate answers to your questions.

At the DM’s discretion, some answers might be so obscure you can only deduce them by tapping into information that you couldn’t possibly know. In such cases, you must succeed on a DC 30 Intelligence check to pull the answer from the collective unconscious. If you are proficient with an appropriate skill to recall lore (such as Arcana, Religion, or Nature) and it applies to the answer you seek (DM’s choice), you may apply double your proficiency bonus to the Intelligence check.

You worm disrupting thoughts into the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 3d8 psychic damage and acts erratically for the duration. An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You ignite your body in psionic fire. While you concentrate, you are immune to fire damage, and any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you takes 3d6 fire damage. Additionally, you shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for the duration.

## Immovability
*4th-level psychoportation*
**Augmenting:** :: *mystic displacement*
**Psi Cost:** :: 8 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 8 hours
For the duration of this augment, you mystically anchor your body and mind to the underlying fabric of reality on your current plane of existence. While so anchored, your weight does not increase but you become next to impossible to move. You gain a +20 bonus on ability checks and saving throws to resist being moved against your will, and you cannot voluntarily allow yourself to be moved for the duration.

While anchored, you automatically fail Dexterity checks and saving throws and cannot take any actions, but you become immune to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Magical effects that would teleport you, or any effect described as “telekinetic” automatically fail when used on you.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 8 additional psi points when manifesting this augment, you manifest it as an 8th-level power, and may do so as a reaction to any action another creature takes, gaining the effects of the augment before the other creature’s action.

## Impaling Shot

**Augmenting:** :: *true shot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You line up an impossible shot that pierces through every creature it hits in a line that is 5 feet wide and as long as the maximum range of the ranged weapon you are currently wielding. If you are not wielding a ranged weapon when you manifest this power, the power fails.

When you manifest this power, you make one ranged weapon attack, and compare the result against the AC of every creature in the line, scoring a hit against all creatures whose AC is equal to or less than the result of your attack roll. Creatures that you hit take force damage equal 2d8 + your weapon’s damage for a normal ranged weapon attack. Creatures that you miss take half as much damage.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the force damage increases by 1d8 for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

**Augmenting:** :: *verve*
**Psi Cost:** :: 17 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: 1 round
You instantly affix the perfect version of yourself in your mind and deny all deviations from that self. You may manifest this power in response to any action, and it manifests quickly enough to apply its effects to you before the triggering action. When you manifest this power, your hit point total returns to its maximum.

Additionally, until the end of your next turn, you are immune to all damage, conditions, and effects other creatures try to inflict or impose upon you.

## Implant Beacon
*1st-level clairsentience*
**Augmenting:** :: *mind thrust*
**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You force a clairsentient beacon into the psyche of a creature you can see. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or else you know the distance and direction between you and the target, as long as you are on the same plane of existence, until the effect ends. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour, ending the effect on a success.

You may only have one beacon active at a time. If you manifest this power on a second target, your awareness of the first one fades, regardless of the second target’s success or failure on the saving throw.

***Intensify.*** If you spend an additional 4 psi points to manifest this augment beyond the minimum cost, the target may only repeat the saving throw when they finish a long rest, ending the effect on a success.

**Augmenting:** :: *mindlink*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:** :: 30 feet
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: 4 or more hours
You telepathically infiltrate the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must remain within 30 feet of you for the entire manifesting time, otherwise the power fails. The target must make three Intelligence saving throws. You plant an idea or false memory in the creature’s mind, the duration of which depends on the number of saving throws it fails.

You choose whether the idea or memory is trivial (such as “I woke up 5 minutes late today” or “Griffons are majestic creatures”) or personality-defining (“I deserted my unit in the war, causing their deaths, and I can barely live with the shame” or “Violence is never the answer, I will never touch a weapon again”).

With one failed saving throw, the idea or memory lasts for the next 4 hours. With two failed saving throws, it lasts for 24 hours. With three failed saving throws, it lasts for 48 hours.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 8 extra psi points to manifest this augment, you manifest it as an 8th-level power, its manifesting time is shortened to 1 minute, and the idea or memory lasts one week with one failed saving throw, one month with two failed saving throws, or is permanent with three failed saving throws.

You distill your telepathic field into a mote of pure fury within the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed in a straight line toward its nearest enemy. On a failure, the target takes half as much damage and does not suffer any further effect. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d6 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You strip all inertia and momentum from a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cut off from nearly all physical and magical interactions. A target can choose to fail this saving throw if they wish.

An affected creature can’t damage or be damaged by attacks or effects, nor can it affect anything else. The creature’s speed is reduced to 0, and it hovers in place, unable to fall.

This power can be dispelled by the *accelerate* power or the *haste* spell, but these then have no further effect on the target.

## Insanity
*6th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *psychic static*
**Psi Cost:** :: 11 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You form your telepathic field into a spike of concentrated madness and ram it into one creature you can see within range, attempting to drive it permanently insane. If the target has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected. On a failed save, maddening whispers and visions fill the creature’s mind. The target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
##### Character Advancement
| 1d10 | Behavior | 
|:------------------:|:-----:|
| 1                | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.     |
| 2--6               | The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.     |
| 7--8               | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.     |
| 9--10            | The creature can act and move normally.     |
}}

A creature affected by this power must make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this power three times, the effect ends. If it fails its save three times, it becomes comatose, subjected to the paralyzed condition for the power’s duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If you maintain your concentration on this power for the entire possible duration, the creature is rendered permanently insane. A permanently insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish.

Permanent insanity lasts until removed by *greater restoration, intensified revitalization, psychic chirurgery*, or similar magic.

**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
When you hit a target with a melee attack, you briefly magnify the force of the blow, launching the target away from you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked 10 feet away from you in a straight line. If the target hits an object, this movement immediately ends and the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost the distance you knock the target back on a failed save increases by 10 feet and the potential damage if it hits an object increases by 1d6.

While frightened by this augment, a target’s speed is reduced to 0, and the target can use its action, and any bonus action it might have, only to make melee attacks. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d6 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

**Augmenting:** :: *blind spot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 17 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
A creature you touch becomes irresistibly captivating to others. For the duration, whenever the target makes a Charisma check, it can replace the number rolled with a 15. Additionally, no matter what the target says, effects that would determine if it is telling the truth indicate that it is being truthful.

## Metaconcert
*1st-level telepathy*

**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: None

The recipients of a memory gain perfect recall of one thing the sender of the memory saw or did.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you can add an additional target creature to your *mindlink* communication for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Metamorphosis
*3rd-level psychometabolism*
**Augmenting:** :: *primal metabolism*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You transmogrify your body into a new form. Choose one of the following effects.

***Change Appearance.*** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same. The change to your appearance lasts for the duration.

***Beast Form.*** You transform into the form of a beast. The transformation lasts for the duration, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. Your new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than your level. Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature. You retain your alignment and personality.

You assume the hit points of your new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

You are limited in the actions you can perform by the nature of your new form, and you can't manifest powers, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

Your gear melds into the new form. You can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of your equipment.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 10 extra psi points when manifesting this augment, you manifest it as an 8th-level power and can transform yourself into any type of creature whose challenge rating is equal to or less than your level, when you use the Beast Form effect.

## Microcosm
*9th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *mind thrust*
**Psi Cost:** :: 17 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
When you manifest this power, you forcefully induce catatonia, isolating consciousness. You can choose to target either a single creature or any number of creatures you can see within range. The targeted creatures suffer one of the effects detailed below, depending on the number of targets.

***Single Target.*** If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, its consciousness is completely cut off from the real world. It perceives an imaginary landscape and creatures, but in reality it falls prone, is incapacitated, and can’t move or speak intelligibly.

***Multiple Targets.*** Any target that has 30 hit points or fewer, up to a maximum of 300 hit points worth of creatures (affecting creatures with the lowest hit points first), suffers a shared catatonic state. All affected creatures can perceive and interact with each other and their shared hallucinatory environment, but are in actuality prone, incapacitated, and unable to move or speak intelligibly. Affected creatures believe they are interacting with each other normally, but are in fact telepathically communicating with other affected creatures and hallucinating physical interactions.

Regardless of the number of targets, affected creatures will eventually die of thirst and starvation without external care. 

*Microcosm*’s effects can only be removed by manifesting *microcosm* on the targets a second time, or by other powerful effects such as *psychic chirurgery, reality revision, or wish*.

## Mind Blast

**Augmenting:** :: *mind thrust*

## Mind Palace
*7th-level metacreativity*
**Augmenting:** :: *imbue psicrystal*
**Psi Cost:** :: 13 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:** :: 120 feet
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: 24 hours
You teleport your psicrystal anywhere in an unoccupied cube of space that is up to 120 feet on each side and with its bottom surface on the ground. If no such space exists within range, the power fails. Once your psicrystal is in place, you begin pulling gooey, ectoplasmic matter from the Gray, enfolding the psicrystal in it. The ectoplasm crystallizes and hardens into an otherworldly structure that fills the cube.

You completely control the growth of the crystalline structure, making all decisions about the structure’s interior chambers and layout, though all interior chambers must connect to others and must be at least 5 feet in any dimension. Interior chambers are otherwise enclosed by floors, walls, and ceilings. Walls can be as thick as 6 inches, blocking light, or thin enough to appear as glass windows. One 10-foot section of the exterior wall on the ground level is a magical entranceway. As an action, you and any creatures you designate when you manifest this power can activate the entranceway when adjacent to it, switching its phases between corporeal and incorporeal states with each activation. Once you finish growing the crystalline structure of your mind palace, your psicrystal detaches itself from an interior wall and awaits further instructions.

Your mind palace is partially extradimensional, and blocks teleportation and planar travel effects within its walls (whether it is the destination or origin point of the effect). Additionally, sensors, eyes, and projections created by divination spells and clairsentience powers can’t appear inside the structure, and creatures inside can’t be targeted by divination or clairsentience effects. The crystallized thought-substance of the structure also diffuses harmful psychic energies, granting resistance to psychic damage to all creatures located inside it.

The crystallized ectoplasm of the mind palace’s structure can’t be dispelled by *dispel magic*, and *antimagic field* has no effect on it. Nothing can physically pass through the structure’s exterior, except the entranceway, when its phase is shifted to incorporeal. An attack or effect that deals at least 10 points of thunder damage destroys a 5-foot section of the wall, or an area of the wall that overlaps with the damage's area of effect if applicable. The crystal is otherwise impervious to damage or harm. When this power’s duration expires, the mind palace evaporates into nothing.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

## Mind Probe
*7th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *mindlink*
**Psi Cost:** :: 13 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:** :: 30 feet
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You delve into the depths of the mind of a creature you are telepathically communicating with. You gain limited access to the complete personal experience of the target, from fleeting memories of everyday events to life-defining moments. For the duration, you may use an action to learn the answer to one question that the target could answer. You do not actually converse with the creature, and need not share a language with it. You merely search the target’s psyche for the information you seek and find it if it is present.

The target may refuse to give you access to an answer if it succeeds on a Charisma saving throw, but success on this saving throw does not end the power. You may continue to seek answers (either to the same question or a different one) in subsequent rounds of the effect, until the duration ends. This power ends early if the target moves out of range.

An unconscious creature automatically provides you answers, but after you receive an answer from it, it may make a Wisdom saving throw if it has at least 1 hit point, becoming conscious on a success.

## Mind Seed
*8th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *mindlink*
**Psi Cost:** :: 15 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You touch one humanoid you are telepathically communicating with and infect it with a parasitic seed of your own psyche. The target must make a Charisma saving throw immediately when you manifest this power on it, and must then repeat the saving throw whenever it finishes a long rest. If the target successfully saves against this power three times, the power ends and the parasitic seed fades away with no effect. If it fails its save three times, the parasitic seed of your psyche in the target’s mind germinates. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

While a creature is still making saves against this power, it acts normally but begins to mimic quirks of your own personality. For instance, if you have a habit of ending sentences with “y’know?” the target begins doing so as well, subconsciously.

If the parasitic seed germinates, the target’s mind is replaced with a duplicate of your own. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores change to match yours at the time you manifested this power on it. The target loses all class levels and class specific NPC traits it might have, and gains the class levels you had 8 levels  ago (in effect, gaining the same experience and abilities you had 8 levels earlier). Its physical ability scores, race, and appearance do not change.

Although the target becomes a mental duplicate of you, you have no special control over it, and its personality may diverge from yours over time. The duplicate psyche’s initial attitude toward you is friendly, but it does not believe itself to be your servant or slave, and it will act as you would if it is treated as such.

Effects that prevent possession prevent you from infecting a target with mind seed, but grant no protection once the seed is already implanted. An intensified *revitalization*, *greater restoration*, or the break enchantment effect of *dispel the supernatural* cast on the target specifically to cleanse it of a growing mind seed does so only if the caster succeeds on a spellcasting or psionic ability check with a DC equal to your power save DC, and only if cast on the target before it fails three saves against mind seed. 

Once the parasitic seed of your psyche germinates in a target, only *reality revision, wish, psychic chirurgery*, or similarly powerful magical effects can restore the target to its original personality and class levels (if applicable).

You disrupt the mind of a creature you can see within range, causing it to lock up. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it is paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw. On a success, this effect ends. On a failure, you can use your reaction to force the target creature to move up to half its speed as you desire, even though it is paralyzed.

**Augmenting:** :: *mind thrust*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points

You cause a 20-foot-radius sphere of intense psionic disruption to appear, centered on a point within range. Each creature in the area must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 4d8 psychic damage and suffers disadvantage on all saving throws until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not suffer any further effect from this power.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d8 for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

You ignite parts of your telepathic field into translucent purple flames of debilitating mental disruption. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:
- ***50 hit points or fewer:*** suffer 1 level of exhaustion that is removed after 1 minute
- ***40 hit points or fewer:*** suffer 2 levels of exhaustion that are removed after 10 minutes
- ***30 hit points or fewer:*** paralyzed for 1 hour

**Duration:** :: 5 minutes
You couch your falsehoods in feelings of trust and acceptance, and deliver them into the mind of another. 

When you manifest this augment, you target one creature you are telepathically communicating with. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you telepathically communicate one statement of your choice to the target, and the target believes that statement for the duration. The statement can be up to ten words long, and it must describe you or a creature or object the target can see. On a successful save, the target is unaffected. 

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being charmed or it succeeded on a saving throw against this augment since the end of your last long rest.

You broadcast a short telepathic message of up to 25-words to every creature within range. Any creature you can see, as well as any creatures that you know or know of in the area can be included or excluded from this communication. This communication is one-way only and instantaneous. If a recipient of your communication does not share a language with you, it perceives only garbled mental gibberish.

## Mystic Ammunition
*2nd-level psychoportation*
**Augmenting:** :: *true shot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, whenever you make a ranged attack with a weapon with the ammunition property, you gain the ability to teleport magical ammunition for the attack into your waiting hand. This requires no further action beyond making the ranged weapon attack. 

The piece of ammunition you summon is appropriate for the weapon you are wielding, but you cannot specify a particular piece of ammunition (such as, “an arrow from the quiver of a creature I can see”). Instead, the ammunition is summoned from mysterious parts unknown, somewhere in the multiverse. 

The magical ammunition you summon has a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. Whether your attack hits or misses, the summoned ammunition teleports away, returning from whence it came.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, until your concentration ends, each summoned piece of ammunition’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases by +1 for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost, to a maximum total bonus of +3.

## Mystic Anchor
*4th-level psychoportation*
**Augmenting:** :: *mystic displacement*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 150 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You fire a thin purple ray from your brow at a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged power attack. On a hit, the target becomes anchored to the plane of existence it is currently on for the duration of this power.

While anchored, teleportation and planar travel effects fail to work on the target, whether the target caused the effect or not. The target is also barred from entering portals to other locations, regardless of the portal's destination or plane of existence.  If an anchored creature attempts to pass through such a portal, they find it an impassable barrier.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you may target one additional creature you can see within range for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Mystic Caravan
*5th-level psychoportation*
**Augmenting:** :: *mystic displacement*
**Psi Cost:** :: 9 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Up to 5 days
You lead a caravan of two or more willing mystic travelers (creatures affected by a *mystic traveler* power you've previously manifested, one of which must be yourself) into the Gray and beyond. When you manifest this power, you must specify another plane of existence as your destination (and may choose a specific location within that plane). Then, all mystic travelers are transported to the Gray, where you begin to travel to your destination. This power automatically fails if you are already in the Gray when you manifest it.

Your journey through the Gray is not instantaneous, instead taking several days, and arrival at your destination is not guaranteed. At the end of each day of travel, you must make a DC 15 Arcana check. Successes bring you closer to your destination and failures lead you further away. Your journey ends if you accrue either three successes or three failures. The DM may grant you disadvantage or advantage on these checks, depending on certain factors.

The result of your journey depends on how many failures you accrued before it ends:

If your journey ends with no failures, all mystic travelers are transported to your intended plane of existence, within 1d10 miles of your destination on that plane if you specified one, or arriving at a random location on that plane if you did not.

If your journey ends with only 1 failure, all mystic travelers are transported to your intended plane of existence, arriving at a random location, but suffer two levels of exhaustion due to the difficult journey.

If your journey ends with 2 failures, you are forced to turn back, arriving within 1d10 miles of the location you manifested this power. Additionally, all mystic travelers suffer four levels of exhaustion as your journey was especially tiring and rough. 

If your journey ends because you accrued 3 failures, all mystic travelers run afoul of turbulent psychic currents within the Gray. Each mystic traveler must make a Charisma saving throw, taking 10d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Then, regardless of the result of the saving throw, each mystic traveler suffers two levels of exhaustion and is transported to a random plane of existence, separated from its fellow travelers.

In addition to the pure navigational challenge of the journey, the DM may describe additional encounters and challenges the mystic travelers might face along the way.

## Mystic Diversion
*7th-level psychoportation*
**Augmenting:** :: *mystic displacement*
**Psi Cost:** :: 13 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: 100 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You manifest this power as a reaction to one creature teleporting into, out of, or within range. The teleporting creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to continue its teleport as normal. If the target fails its save, it teleports to a destination of your choice instead of its intended destination, provided the destination you choose is within the normal range of the teleportation effect.

## Mystic Traveler
*1st-level psychoportation*
**Augmenting:** :: *mystic displacement*
**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
You or one willing creature you touch become a mystic traveler, able to join a group journey enabled by the *mystic caravan* power. This power’s duration ends early if the mystic traveler is not affected by you manifesting *mystic caravan* within 1 hour of manifesting this power. This power also ends early if the *mystic caravan* journey ends.

For the duration of a *mystic caravan* journey, mystic travelers must remain within 15 feet of at least one other mystic traveler. If a mystic traveler is out of this formation for more than 1 round, the *mystic traveler* power is automatically dispelled on that creature, and it is sent tumbling through the rough psychic currents of the Gray. Such creatures must make a Charisma saving throw, taking 10d6 psychic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success, and are then transported to a random plane of existence.

## Negate
*3rd-level psychokinesis*
**Augmenting:** :: *psychic hammer*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
When you visually, audibly, or mentally perceive a creature within 60 feet of you generate a psionic effect, you attempt to negate their psionic power and stop it from coming to fruition. If the target is casting a psionic talent, the casting fails. If the target is manifesting a psionic power of a level equal to this power’s level or lower, the manifesting fails and the target’s focus on a psionic talent ends. If the target is manifesting a power of a level higher than this power’s level, make a psionic ability check. The DC of this check equals 10 + the power level of the target's power. On a success, the target’s power fails to manifest, and its focus on a psionic talent ends.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, this augment’s power level increases by 1 for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Noise Barrier
*4th-level psychokinesis*
**Augmenting:** :: *energy ray*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You mentally excite the air molecules before you, forming a wall of pure sound. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. At least one 10-foot-long section of the wall must be within range when you form the wall. The wall lasts for the duration. Every foot moved through the wall costs 1 extra foot of movement. When a creature moves into the wall’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or it takes 6d6 thunder damage, is pushed in a straight line up to 30 feet away from the wall, and is knocked prone.

The wall blocks any sound from passing through it, and the cacophony it creates can be heard up to 500 feet away. If another effect that deals thunder damage overlaps with the wall or crosses through it, the wall absorbs the effect, dispelling or destroying it.

You create a 5-foot cube of dim, gray light within 5 feet of you, and an identical cube at any point of your choice within 1 mile that you have viewed within the past 24 hours. The cubes last for the duration. A creature entering one of the cubes immediately teleports to the other one, appearing in an unoccupied space next to it. The teleportation fails if there is no space for the creature to appear in.

**Duration:** :: 8 hours
You fold the fabric of time and space to create a harmless singularity in a 5-foot cube you can see within range. For the next 8 hours, whenever another ability or effect allows you to teleport to a destination, you can instead teleport to the singularity, regardless of the normal range of the teleport allowed by the other effect, and regardless of whether you can see the singularity or not.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 2 additional psi points beyond the minimum cost to manifest this augment, you manifest it as a 5th level power and you can take up to six additional willing creatures with you when you teleport to the singularity, assuming all targets were also affected by the other ability or effect that allowed you to teleport.

**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You incite stark, raving panic in up to 8 creatures you can see within range. For the duration, each target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, the target is frightened until the start of its next turn. Roll a die for each frightened target. 

If you roll an odd number, that target moves half its speed in a random direction and takes no action on that turn, other than to scream in terror. 

If you roll an even number, the frightened target makes one melee attack against a random creature within its reach. If there is no such creature, the target moves half its speed in a random direction and takes no action on that turn. This effect ends on a target if it succeeds on three saving throws against it.

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it must target its allies with attacks and other damaging effects for the duration of this augment. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to being frightened.

**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
When you cast *imbue psicrystal*, you may manifest this augment as a reaction to impart the psicrystal with a facet of your personality. If you do, for as long as you focus on *imbue psicrystal*, the psicrystal is linked to a particular skill and gains the ability to use its reaction to roll a d6 and add the result to one ability check you make with that skill, so long as you are within 15 feet of the psicrystal. The psicrystal may take this reaction after you roll the ability check, but it must do so before the DM determines if the result was a success or failure.

The skill that the psicrystal can give you a bonus to is determined by the of personality you impart it with. Choose from one of the options below.

***Artiste.*** Charisma (Performance) checks.

***Bully.*** Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

***Cautious.*** Wisdom (Survival) checks.

## Phantom Menace
*2nd-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *blind spot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You cause one creature you can see within range to perceive a horrifying figment of its imagination. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target believes a horrifying creature is adjacent to it until your concentration ends.

During this time, the target can’t take reactions, and takes 1d8 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being frightened.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage every round increases by 1d8 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Polar Vortex
*3rd-level psychokinesis*
**Augmenting:** :: *energy ray*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 120 feet
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a point you can see within range. The air in a 20-foot- radius sphere centered on that point becomes deathly cold and  instantly freezes creatures in place. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 4d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until your concentration ends. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and suffers no further effect.

As an action, a target that has its speed reduced can end that effect early if it succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC equal to your power save DC.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d8 for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Post-Hypnotic Suggestion
*4th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *mindlink*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Up to 7 days
You mentally implant a suggested course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and a triggering event (such as “when you awake two days from now” or “when you come within sixty feet of the local Countess”) to magically influence a creature you are telepathically communicating with. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.

When you manifest this power, the target must immediately make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the target perceives a faint whisper intruding into its mind, but is not otherwise affected, and you know the suggestion did not take hold. On a failure, the suggestion and trigger are telepathically implanted in the target without their notice. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Suggesting the creature stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.

Once the triggering condition is met, the target pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 8 hours after the triggering condition is met. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was influenced to do. The target will not be able to explain why it took the actions you compelled it to take after the suggestion is triggered and it will have no memory of the suggestion or trigger being implanted.

Whenever the target creature finishes a long rest, it may repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success, though it will still not realize it was affected. If the triggering condition is not met before the power expires, the suggested activity isn’t performed. If you or any of your companions damage the target, the power ends.

## Project Eidolon
*3rd-level metacreativity*
**Augmenting:** :: *imbue psicrystal*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:** :: 30 feet
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Up to 1 hour
You move your psicrystal to an unoccupied space within range, then draw matter from the Gray, coalescing it around your psicrystal into the shape of an eidolon—a construct made of solid thought. Your psicrystal becomes the core of this eidolon. Its statistics are completely replaced by the eidolon’s and you cannot manifest a power that augments *imbue psicrystal* again while the eidolon exists. The eidolon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, when this power’s duration expires, or when you stop focusing on *imbue psicrystal*. When the eidolon disappears, your psicrystal remains behind, and occupies one space previously occupied by the eidolon. As a reaction, you may direct your psicrystal to teleport to your space immediately after the eidolon disappears.

For the duration of its existence, the eidolon is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on the same initiative count as you, directly after your turn. You can use an action to give the eidolon a verbal or mental command, and it obeys any such commands that you issue to it. If you don’t issue any commands to the eidolon, it takes the Dodge action to defend itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

The eidolon’s base statistics are detailed in the Athasian Bestiary. When you manifest this power, you can select one  ability from the Lesser Eidolon Abilities menu and apply it to the eidolon’s base statistics for free.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you may select one additional ability from the Lesser Eidolon Abilities menu for each additional psi point beyond the minimum cost, and apply it to the eidolon’s statistics.

For every 2 psi points you spend to intensify this power from 5th to 6th level or higher, you may select an ability from the Greater Eidolon Abilities menu instead of two choices from the Lesser Eidolon Abilities menu.

**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You probe the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must remain within 30 feet of you for the entire manifesting time, otherwise the augment fails. The target must make three Wisdom saving throws, and you learn information from it based on the number of saving throws it fails. The target may voluntarily fail any saves. If the target succeeds on all three saving throws, this power fails.

If the target fails any saves, you learn the details of events from the target’s memories that it considers significant. With one failed saving throw, you learn such details from the past 12 hours; with two failed saving throws, you learn such details from the past 24 hours; and with three failed saving throws, you learn such details from the past 48 hours.

**Augmenting:** :: *mindlink*

**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You telepathically enter the mind of willing creature you touch, and skillfully repair or improve its psyche. When you manifest this power, you choose one of the following effects.

***Repair.*** If the target is charmed or frightened, you instantly end those conditions on the target. You also automatically end any effect that mentally limits or dictates actions the creature can take (such as *id insinuation*, *ego whip*, or the *command* or *confusion* spells), possession, permanent insanity, madness, or a reduction in maximum hit points caused by an effect that dealt psychic damage. Additionally you restore the creature’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores to normal if they were reduced by another effect.

***Improve.*** If you choose this effect, you begin to concentrate. If you maintain your concentration for a full minute, you permanently bestow the target creature with the ability to cast one psionic talent that you know, or the *wild technique* talent. You also permanently reduce your psi reserve maximum by 2 each time you manifest this power to improve a creature this way. This reduction applies to any increased maximum psi reserve you attain for gaining a level, and it can only be reversed with *reality revision* or *wish*.

While you concentrate, you may use your action to move the object up to 60 feet. You must keep the object within sight during this movement. If your concentration ends while the object is in the air, it falls.

You may also use your action to end your concentration early and launch the object at a creature you can see within range.

**Manifesting Time:** :: 16 hours
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You guide a creature you touch through mediation to psychically reorganize its memories and past experiences, following different pathways of causality. The target creature must concentrate (as if concentrating on a power), and you must remain in contact with it for the entire manifesting time, or you fail to manifest this augment.

When you manifest this augment, the target creature can choose to do any of the following:
- Lose proficiency in one of its skills and gain proficiency in another.
- Lose proficiency in one tool it is proficient with and gain proficiency in another.
- Forget one language it knows and learn another.
- Change any decisions it made for any Ability Score Improvement class feature it previously gained, including the decision to take a feat it meets the prerequisites for, if applicable.
- Forget a spell or augment known and choose a different one of the same level.

The target can choose to do any of the above effects any number of times, however each time an effect is chosen, the maximum hit point total of both you and the target are reduced by 2. This reduction lasts for each creature respectively until it gains a level, and cannot be removed with *greater restoration*, *revitalization*, *psychic chirurgery*, or similar magic.

**Augmenting:** :: *psychic static*

You feed on the psyche of a creature that you can see within range, gaining power by draining its mental faculties.

You increase your current and maximum hit points by 1 for every point of Intelligence or Charisma the target creature lost. This increase lasts until you finish a long rest.

If the target fails its saving throw, it can’t cast spells, manifest powers, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligent way. It can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.

At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this power. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the power’s effects end.

This power’s effect on a target can also be ended by *greater restoration, heal, psychic chirurgery, wish, reality revision*, or an intensified *revitalization*.

As you concentrate, you become sensitive to the psychic impressions left by historical events in the area. Normal everyday occurrences do not leave impressions strong enough to sense, rather you perceive events with strong emotional resonances, such as battles, weddings, murders, and births.

You perceive these events as if you were an unnoticed bystander anywhere in the area, witnessing them as they happened. Your “vision” of the event is lightly obscured, as if by dim light or mist, but otherwise you view the event as though with truesight, detecting invisible creatures and sensing the apparent and true form of magically disguised creatures. Additionally, you identify the primary emotion left by the event, such as terror, joy, or anger. You can perceive events only within the limits of the area; your historical “vision” is completely obscured beyond this power’s radius.

Your concentration ends early if you move from your space. For every full 10 minutes that you concentrate, you perceive one historical event strong enough to leave psychic impressions, starting with the most recent and then going backwards in time.

You can sense historical events as far back as 500 years, assuming your concentration lasts long enough to do so.

**Augmenting:** :: *sixth sense*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You read the aura of one object you touch while you concentrate. If you maintain contact with the object for the complete duration, you learn a fact about the object. Choose from one of the options below:
- The race, gender, age, and alignment of the last owner of the object (a creature in personal possession of the object for more than 7 days).
- A vision of the last time the object was touched by someone other than you or creatures you can see. The vision is from the perspective of the object, as if it could see as well as a human, in any direction you choose, and lasts for 10 minutes, at the end of which the item was let go.
- Whether the item is magical or not and, if it is, all of its magical properties, as if you cast identify on it.

## Psychosomatic Feedback

**Augmenting:** :: *psychic static*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You sharpen your telepathic field into a sensory feedback loop, causing creatures in the area to believe they feel the pain that they inflict on you. For the duration, whenever a creature in the area deals damage to you, it automatically takes 7 psychic damage, ignoring all resistances and immunities to psychic damage the creature might have. A creature that suffers this damage believes it to be of the same type they inflicted on you.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

On a failed save, the target takes 1d10 fire damage, and it catches on fire, taking 1d6 fire damage at the end of each of its turns until your concentration ends or until it or a creature adjacent to it extinguishes the flames with an action. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t catch fire.

## Reality Revision
*9th-level metacreativity*
**Augmenting:** :: *aura beacon*
**Psi Cost:** :: 18 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
The power to reshape reality as one desires is the mightiest power a mortal being can possess. When you manifest this power, a visible ripple in space and time propagates out from you, and, in its wake, the world is revised to your liking.

The basic use of this power is to duplicate any other power or spell of 8th level or lower. If you duplicate an augment, you don't need to focus on the augment’s appropriate talent, and any other requirements of the augment simply appear. If duplicating a spell, it doesn't require any of its usual material components. 

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:
- You create one object of up to 25,000 ct in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the revitalization power (including its intensified effects).
- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single power, spell, or other magical effect for 8 hours. 
- You undo a single event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn), choosing whether to roll with advantage or disadvantage, and whether to use the original roll or the reroll. 

\column

::::::::::::

 {{width:7px}} You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your desired revision of reality to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the revision, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. The revision might simply fail to take hold, the effect you desire might only be partially achieved, or you might suffer some undesirable outcome as the result of a runaway butterfly effect you failed to anticipate. 

The stress of manifesting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power or spell taxes you mentally and physically. After enduring that stress, each time you manifest a power or cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 psychic damage per level of that magical effect. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.

Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that the psi points you spent to manifest reality revision are permanently burned, reducing your maximum psi reserve by 18 points. This reduction cannot be reversed by mortal means, even with a *wish* spell or another *reality revision*, and it applies to any increased maximum psi reserve you attain for gaining a level.

## Realized Potential
*4th-level psychometabolism*
**Augmenting:** :: *wild technique*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You unlock the potential in yourself or a creature you touch. The target gains 30 temporary hit points. In addition, for the duration of this power, whenever the target makes an ability check, attack roll, or a saving throw, the target can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Any remaining temporary hit points granted by this power disappear when your concentration ends.

## Remote Projection
*5th-level clairsentience*
**Augmenting:** :: *sixth sense*
**Psi Cost:** :: 9 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're manifesting this power, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

{{classTable,frame,decoration
| Knowledge | Save Modifier |
|:--:|:-----------:|
| Secondhand (you've heard of the target)  | +5 |
| Firsthand (you have met the target) | +0  |
| Familiar (you know the target well) | --5 |

| Connection | Save Modifier |
|:--:|:-----------:|
| Likeness or picture  | --2 |
| Possession or garment  | --4  |
| Lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | --10 |

}}

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this power against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, you create an invisible projection of yourself within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the projection as if it were your body. The projection moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible creatures sees the projection as an indistinct, translucent humanoid unrecognizable as you. Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this power. When you do, the projection appears at that location and doesn't move.

## Revitalization
*3rd-level psychometabolism*
**Augmenting:** :: *autonomous vitality*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You touch one creature and restore vigor to it. Remove one of the following conditions from the touched creature: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. Alternatively, you remove one disease from the creature.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 6 additional psi points beyond this augment’s minimum cost, you manifest it as a 6th-level power, and the list of conditions you can remove from the touched creature expands to include the following: all reductions to one of its ability scores, an effect that reduces its hit point maximum, one level of exhaustion, or any other effect specifically noted as removable with the *greater restoration* spell.

## Ring of Blades
*3rd-level metacreativity*
**Augmenting:** :: *mindblade*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self (15-foot radius)
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create dozens of floating duplicates of your mindblade and send them whizzing about you in a ring. The ring of blades is 10 feet high and can have a radius up to 15 feet (5 feet minimum). The ring moves with you, remaining centered on you.

Whenever a creature enters the ring’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you may choose for it to be affected by the blades. If it is so affected, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 damage of the damage type your mindblade currently deals. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

As a bonus action on your turn, you may contract or expand the ring’s radius to be anywhere within the above limits. Moving the ring this way onto a creature does not damage it until it starts its turn in the ring’s space, as above.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d8 for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Savage Presence
*2nd-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *psychic static*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You alter your telepathic field to emanate waves of rage and bloodlust. Until your concentration ends, you and any creature within 60 feet of you has advantage on melee attack rolls. You can only voluntarily end your concentration on this power if you begin concentrating on another effect; your instilled bloodlust is too strong to deny on a mere whim.

## Seeking Shot
*2nd-level psychokinesis*
**Augmenting:** :: *true shot*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: A ranged weapon attack
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
As part of making a ranged weapon attack with a ranged weapon you touch, you may manifest this power to imbue the weapon’s fired ammunition with a psychokinetic charge that seeks the mind of an intelligent target. If the target of your ranged weapon attack has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher, your attack ignores half cover and three-quarters cover. Additionally, against such a target, your fired ammunition can make one turn of up to 90 degrees in order to bypass total cover (for example, firing around a corner, or over a wall) provided that you are aware of the target’s presence.

## Self-Actualization
*1st-level clairsentience*
**Augmenting:** :: *sixth sense*
**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: 1 hour
You meditate deeply and contemplate on knowledge you seek, pulling the information from the collective unconscious. For the duration, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Animal Handling, Arcana, History, Medicine, Nature, Performance, Religion, or Survival.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, you may choose one additional skill to gain proficiency in for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Sense Link
*3rd-level clairsentience*
**Augmenting:** :: *wild technique*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 200 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You link your senses of sight and hearing to one willing creature you can see within range. While you concentrate, you can see through the target’s eyes and hear what it hears, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the target might have. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

As an action, and if the target is willing, you can reverse this link so the target sees through your eyes and hears what you hear.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 4 extra psi points beyond the minimum cost to manifest this augment, you manifest this augment as a 5th level power, and the target of the power does not need to be willing, either for the initial manifestation or the reversing of its effects as an action. If the target is not willing, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the power fails. On a failure, the unwilling target is affected, but may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration of the power, ending it on a success.

## Share Pain
*3rd-level psychometabolism*
**Augmenting:** :: *autonomous vitality*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You forcefully attune the vital rhythm of a creature you can see within range to match your own. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or you become linked for as long as you concentrate. A creature may choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. At the end of each of its turns, the target may choose to make another Constitution saving throw, ending the link on a success.

While linked, you and the target have resistance to all damage, and each time you or the creature takes damage, the other linked creature takes the same amount of damage.

The link ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if this power or the warding bond spell is placed on either of the linked creatures. You may also end the link as an action.

If you target a creature currently affected by warding bond with this power and they fail their saving throw, the warding bond spell ends on that creature.

## Share Thoughts
*2nd-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *mindlink*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self (500-foot radius)
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
When you manifest this augment, and as your action on each turn until your concentration ends, you can focus your mind on one creature you are telepathically communicating with.

When you initially begin to focus on a creature, you initially learn its surface thoughts—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, this power ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

## Shatter Defenses
*6th-level psychokinesis*
**Augmenting:** :: *mind thrust*
**Psi Cost:** :: 11 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: 1 minute
You touch a creature and attempt to annihilate any and all defenses against mental and psionic effects it may have. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by this power.

Any temporary magical effect on an affected creature that grants it resistance or immunity to psychic damage, advantage against or immunity to being charmed or frightened, or immunity to enchantment, telepathy, divination, or clairsentience effects, ends early (including *mind blank*, *veiled psyche*, and similar effects).

If the affected creature is benefiting from a permanent trait, feature, or magical effect that grants resistance or immunity to psychic damage or advantage against or immunity to being charmed or frightened (such as a Villichi human's racial traits, a Crusader’s Aura of Courage feature, or a *ring of mind shielding*), those defenses cease to function for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a creature whose permanent defenses are being suppressed in this way can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.





## Shatter Invisibility
*3rd-level psychokinesis*
**Augmenting:** :: *psychic hammer*
**Psi Cost:** :: 5 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self (50-foot radius)
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
From your brow, a wave of attenuated force bursts out and disrupts all magic in range that veils sight. The duration of a magical effect that renders a creature invisible ends on a creature if that creature fails a Dexterity saving throw and if that magic effect is of an equal or lower level than this power.

Any creature that is invisible due to an effect that does not have a level (including creatures with natural invisibility such as the invisible stalker) and fails its saving throw is instead briefly revealed as a dim outline, which removes its invisibility until the end of your next turn.

## Solicit Psicrystal
*5th-level telepathy*
**Augmenting:** :: *imbue psicrystal*
**Psi Cost:** :: 9 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled
When you manifest this power, your psicrystal takes over focus for the *imbue psicrystal* power, allowing you to begin focusing on another psionic talent without ending the duration of *imbue psicrystal*. Additionally, if you begin concentrating on any other power, spell, or feature within 1 minute after manifesting this augment, you may use your reaction to transfer your concentration on that effect to your psicrystal. Once your psicrystal begins concentrating on this other effect, this power ends if the psicrystal loses concentration.

Until your psicrystal’s focus and/or concentration ends, it cannot take any actions or reactions except those specified in the effect it is concentrating on, and you cannot manifest any other powers that augment *imbue psicrystal*. While your psicrystal concentrates, your psicrystal must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this power and its concentration on a failure.

## Soothing Impulse

**Augmenting:** :: *autonomous vitality*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You unleash a pulse of soothing vigor. Choose up to 3 creatures you can see within range. Each target gains 9 temporary hit points. Intensify. When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the number of temporary hit points targets gain from this augment increases by 3 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Sow Psicrystal
*8th-level metacreativity*
**Augmenting:** :: *imbue psicrystal*
**Psi Cost:** :: 15 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:** :: Touch
**Components:** :: None
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You imprint within your psicrystal a metacreative seed of a duplicate of yourself. The seed must germinate for 120 days before it is viable.

If your seed germinates for the full 120 days and becomes viable, it remains dormant and tethered to your soul. At any time after the seed becomes viable, if you die, the crystal housing your seed shatters and is permanently destroyed as the seed blooms into a metacreative duplicate of your body in its prime. Your soul then enters the duplicate body, provided your soul is free and you are willing to return to life. Your duplicated body is identical to your original one, except for its possible younger age, and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of your original body’s equipment. Your original body’s remains, if they still exist, become inert and can’t thereafter be restored to life, since your soul is elsewhere.

The metacreative seed, whether currently germinating or in a dormant, viable state, evaporates and is destroyed if the crystal you use as a material component for *imbue psicrystal* spends more than 12 consecutive hours as a mundane crystal, or if it is permanently destroyed.

## Spectral Mist
*5th-level metacreativity*
**Augmenting:** :: *ectoplasmic object*
**Psi Cost:** :: 9 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 90 feet
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You draw a significant quantity of ectoplasm from the Gray and create a roiling, tangible mist of turbulent psychic energy with it. The mist fills an area consisting of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. On your turn, you can direct any or all cubes of the mist’s area to move up to 20 feet in any direction, but they must still be adjacent to one another during and after this movement. The mist lasts for the duration, or until strong wind disperses it, ending the power.

The mist can occupy the same space as other creatures and objects, and its area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the mist’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 9 psychic damage from the mist’s psychic turbulence. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to cast spells or manifest powers. On a failure, the casting or manifesting time is wasted, but spell slots or psi points are not.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1 for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost. For every 2 additional psi points you spend, the mist’s area increases by one 10-foot cube.

## Spectral Shell
*4th-level metacreativity*
**Augmenting:** :: *ectoplasmic object*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 90 feet
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You pull matter from the Gray and create a shell of solid ectoplasm around a Medium or smaller creature you can see within range. The target is encased in the shell if they fail a Dexterity saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. The shell lasts until your concentration ends and protects the target from harm while it is trapped inside, providing it total cover from all attacks and effects originating outside of the  shell. The target is visible only as a vague shadow within the shell, obscuring line of sight to the creature. The shell has AC 18 and 20 hit points, and weighs as much as the creature trapped inside.

While inside the shell, the target can breathe but can’t move or speak, and it can take only take actions that do not require physical movement (such as casting a spell with no verbal or somatic components, or manifesting a psionic power). Teleportation effects can be used to escape the shell, but the ectoplasmic matter of the shell extends into the Gray and blocks ethereal travel.

A target that is trapped in a shell while flying falls immediately, but the shell protects it from falling damage. The ectoplasmic shell is buoyant, and floats to the surface if it encases a creature underwater.

When the power ends, the ectoplasmic shell evaporates.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 8 additional psi points beyond the minimum cost to manifest this augment, you manifest it as an 8th- level power, and it potentially traps all creatures regardless of size  fully within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range (provided they fail their saving throws). Each creature is trapped in an individual shell, and the shells created have AC 20 and 50 hit points.

**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You pull ectoplasm from the Gray and create a solid, translucent staircase that lasts until your concentration ends. The stairs form a spiral that fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot area, and reaches upward 20 feet.

When the augment ends, the ectoplasmic staircase evaporates.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the staircase increases in height by up to 20 feet for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Spectral Wall

**Psi Cost:** :: 1 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet

**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You pull matter from the Gray and create a wall of cloudy ectoplasm that lasts until your concentration ends. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. At least one 10-foot section of the wall must be within range when you create it. Creatures can pass through the wall without hindrance, but the wall blocks vision.

When the power ends, the ectoplasmic wall evaporates.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 2 additional psi points beyond the minimum cost to manifest this augment, you fortify the wall with more ectoplasm on creation, making it solid. Creatures cannot pass through the solid version of the wall. Each 5-foot wide section of this wall has AC 12 and 10 hit points. Breaking one section creates a 5-foot by 5-foot hole in it, but the wall otherwise remains intact until your concentration ends.

**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You pull ectoplasmic matter from the Gray and form it into a 20-foot square area of sticky, psychoactive webbing starting from a point within range. For the duration, the web turns the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you manifest this augment must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the web until the augment ends. A creature restrained by the web can use its action to make a Strength check against your power save DC. On a success, it frees itself. Regardless of success or failure, however, the creature’s struggles activate the web’s psychoactive strands, causing them to constrict. The creature attempting to escape takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage, plus another 2d4 bludgeoning damage for each previous failed attempt to escape the web (2d4 for the first failure, 4d4 for the second, 6d4 for the third, etc.).

When the augment ends, the ectoplasmic web evaporates.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

## Suspend Life
*7th-level psychometabolism*
**Augmenting:** :: *verve*
**Psi Cost:** :: 13 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled or dismissed
You descend into a meditative trance so deep your body enters suspended animation. While in this trance you are paralyzed, but are resistant to all damage and immune to poison and disease (a poison or disease already in your system is suspended, not neutralized), and you cease to age. Additionally, while you meditate, divination and clairsentience effects do not recognize that you exist, and are unable to target you.

For the duration of this power, you are aware of your surroundings, but perceive time differently. Events rapidly progress around you, such that every actual year passing feels like a day to you. This makes it next to impossible to communicate with you, even telepathically.

If you attempt to wake yourself and dismiss this power, it takes you 1 minute to do so. If you have taken damage, you can attempt to instantly rouse yourself by making a Constitution saving throw against your own power save DC. On a success, you dismiss this power at the end of your next turn after having taken damage. On a failure, you remain in your meditative trance.

If your *verve* talent is dispelled, you rouse instantly but are dazed until the end of your next turn. While dazed, you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and your speed is halved.

**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Visible arcs of synaptic lightning extend from your brow to strike creatures before you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, and if the target is wearing heavy armor it makes the save with disadvantage. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 lightning damage, and it has disadvantage on ability checks and ranged attacks until your concentration ends. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t suffer any further effects.

A target suffering the effects of failed saving throw can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this power’s effects on itself on a success.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d10 for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the minimum cost.

## Telekinetic Clutch
*2nd-level psychokinesis*
**Augmenting:** :: *psychic hammer*
**Psi Cost:** :: 3 psi point
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You seize a creature you can see within range and hold it fast with telekinetic force. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be grappled by you until your concentration ends or until the target leaves your reach, which is 60 feet for this grapple. 

The grappled target can escape by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your psionic ability plus your proficiency bonus. When a target attempts to escape in this way, you can spend additional psi points to gain a +1 bonus per psi point spent on your check.

While a target is grappled in this manner, you can create one of the following effects as an action, spending the indicated number of additional psi points (obeying your psi limit each time you create an effect):

***Crush (1--18 psi).*** The target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per psi point spent.

***Move (1--18 psi).*** You move the target up to 5 feet per psi point spent. You can move it in the air and hold it there. It falls if the grapple ends.

**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A, O
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You telekinetically seize a creature you can see in range and force its limbs to move with brute mental force. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you gain control of it, allowing you to decide its movement and actions on its turns while you concentrate.

Due to your crude method of control, the target’s speed is halved for its turn and, if you force it to take any action that requires an ability check or attack roll, the target has disadvantage on the check or roll. You cannot force the target to start or stop breathing, or force it to speak, cast spells, or take purely mental actions such as manifesting psionic powers.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, your control of the target’s body ends.

## Telekinetic Push

On a successful save, the target takes half  damage and suffers no  effects.

***Intensify.*** When you spend extra psi points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d8 for each additional psi point spent.

## Temporal Regression
*9th-level psychoportation*
**Augmenting:** :: *mystic displacement*
**Psi Cost:** :: 17 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: Self
**Components:** :: O
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous
You transport yourself backwards in time. The process of regressing yourself to an earlier point in time is exceedingly difficult and dangerous. If you are not in combat, you can attempt to travel backwards in time up to 8 hours, but if you manifest this power while in combat, you can only attempt to regress time back to the point at which you rolled for initiative. You must succeed on a psionic ability check against your own power save DC to successfully use this power. On a failure, you remain in the present, take 10d6 force damage that cannot be mitigated in any way, and the psi points you spent are permanently burned, reducing your maximum psi reserve by 17 points. This reduction cannot be reversed by mortal means, even with a *wish* spell or the *reality revision* power, and it applies to any increased maximum psi reserve you attain for gaining a level.

When you travel back in time, only you retain knowledge of the future in which you lived, but small variances in random variables can produce different outcomes to the ones you might expect (for example, a game of chance you witnessed the first time around might not result in the exact same outcome you first witnessed). The DM has the final call on the state of the world and the creatures in it after you manifest this power.

Likewise, a combat that you return to the beginning of may have wildly different results, necessitating that the entire encounter be replayed.

Your condition returns to what it was at the end of your previous turn, minus the psi cost of manifesting this power. You must maintain an accurate record of your hit points, psi points, uses remaining of features, and other pertinent information regarding your overall condition for the point to which you return. If you do not have an accurate record of such information, the power fails. This power only returns your inherent features to their previous state, it has no effect on your equipment, including magic items.

**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action

When this power ends, the target reappears in the space it was occupying when shunted or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. A shunted target perceives no personal time passing between the moment it was shunted and when it reappears.

***Intensify.*** For every 2 additional psi points spent when you manifest this augment, the power’s range increases by 10 feet and you may target one additional creature in range.

You partially open your third eye, or the third eye of a willing creature you touch, granting the target a mystic sense that allows it to perceive what would not normally be possible. Until your concentration ends, the target can see all creatures, including hidden and invisible ones, regardless of lighting conditions.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 2 additional psi points when manifesting this augment beyond its minimum cost, you manifest it as a 4th level power, and you open the target creature’s third eye even wider, granting them this augment’s normal effects and allowing them to see through objects that are up to 1 foot thick within 30 feet of them.

If you spend a total of 4 additional psi point when manifesting this augment beyond its minimum cost, you manifest it as a 5th level power, opening the creature’s third eye completely, granting them this augment’s 3rd and 4th-level effects, plus truesight with a range of 30 feet for the duration of the power.


## Thought Projection
*4th-level clairsentience*
**Augmenting:** :: *sixth sense*
**Psi Cost:** :: 7 psi points
**Manifesting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:** :: 60 feet
**Components:** :: A
**Duration:** :: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create a psychic projection within 60 feet of you, hovering in the air. The projection lasts for as long as you concentrate and is invisible. It has normal vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet and can look in all directions, and you mentally receive visual information from it. As an action, you can move the projection up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the projection can move, but it can’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the projection’s movement, but it can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 1 additional psi point beyond the minimum cost, the projection you create can move through solid objects, but can’t end its movement in one. If it does so, the power immediately ends.

While you are Huge, this augment’s bonus damage to melee weapon attacks increases to 2d6 extra bludgeoning damage, and your reach increases by 10 feet instead of 5.

***Intensify.*** If you spend 2 additional psi points when manifesting this augment beyond its minimum cost, you manifest it as a 5th-level power, and any creature affected by a power you manifest  that augments primal metabolism does not benefit from immunity to the poisoned condition if that power poisons them.

**Psi Cost:** :: 2 psi points

# Appendix A: Athasian Planes

::::::::::::::::::::::



## The Gray
The Gray is a dreary, endless space, the place Athasians go when they die. This infinite expanse of ashen haze attracts the spirits of the dead once they give up the confines of their mortal raiment. In the Gray, the dead exist in a sort of limbo, floating aimlessly in the ether or assuming the forms they held in life. Eventually, the spirits of the dead are dissolved and absorbed into the Gray, much as their corpses are slowly obliterated by rot and decay on Athas. From these eroded vestiges, new souls were once birthed again into the Material Plane, journeying for a lifetime until they were once again called to dust and ash. 

After the vast devastation brought by defilers of past ages, this cycle of death and rebirth has been sundered. The Gray hangs over the planet of Athas like a burial shroud, visible as a shadowy mist to those beyond and invisible to the beings within. Where once it was but an ethereal veil overlapping Athas, it now acts as a barrier, so choked with death that nothing can pass through or beyond. The Outer Planes are known to none yet living, and have forgotten Athas in turn, condeming the ruined world to its fate in exile. 

### The Plane of Dreams
The Gray doesn't have layers like other planes, yet there is more to it than mere death. All souls bear some connection to the plane, even in their brief sojourns to the world of the living. Through this connection, the living beings of Athas create psychic impressions, shadows of their every thought and feeling. 

Mortal dreamers drift into the Gray during deep slumber, forging brief pockets of memory and desire made manifest by the ambient psionic energy of the Gray. Some powerful psionicists can draw upon this connection at will, calling the raw psionic energy of the Gray into the waking world. 


\column


## The Material Plane
Athas itself – the planet, its lands, the denizens thereof – resides on the material plane. This is the plane  mortals call reality, a place of static matter and brief, fleeting lives. Bordered by the Gray and the Black, fed and shaped by the Elemental Plane, it is the culmination of countless cosmic forces working in tandem to forge a mortal experience.

Though the Gray chokes Athas off from all that lies beyond, some of the Material Plane can yet be seen through its ethereal barrier. The twin moons Ral and Guthay, one a striking viridian green and the other a mottled straw-yellow, pass overhead with each night, and the Dark Sun burns perpetually in the day, its cracked black gaze ever glaring upon Athas. It is said that once Athas and its moons were not alone, that the Material Plane once consisted of countless worlds, orbiting suns not dark and dying but bright and dyed in all the hues of the universe. Perhaps it is even true. 

## The Black
The Black is a realm which separates everything that exists from everything that doesn't, an immense void in the fabric of the planet itself. The Black lies wherever light creates shadows; in the absence of light, no connection to the Black exists. It has been described as a continually shifting, twisted place that imperfectly mirrors Athas itself, its dark reflection buried beneath the shallow grave of Athas' deserts like a vast, leathery egg, filled with spite and silence, ready to hatch and consume the world above. While Athas exists outside the shell of this metaphorical egg, the inside is a world of chilling gloom and utter darkness. 

If the ravings of shadow-mad Arcanists are to be believed, some things which might be called living lurk within. Giants of shadow that walk endlessly through the void, their hate a hungry sharp-toothed maw waiting eagerly to consume any interlopers. 

The truth, known only to the the most ancient of beings within Athas, is that these shadow giants are the loyal servants of Emperor Rajaat, the First Sorcerer. To complete their betrayal of Rajaat, the Champions which would one day be called Sorcerer-Kings trapped his kin within the Black, sentencing them to watch from eternal shadow as those who betrayed them claimed the world.


### The Hollow
Deep within the shell of the Black lies the Hollow, a realm of absolute nothingness. It resides in no one physical location of Athas, for in many ways it does not exist at all. It is an antithesis of thought, a void which both is and is not. Within the vast emptiness of the Hollow, Rajaat  languishes in a prison formed of treachery and magic. Ever does he rage there, clawing at his prison walls, rabid and despairing.

## The Elemental Plane



The elemental planes, sometimes called the Inner Planes, represent the material building blocks of the universe. The elemental realms of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water are each realms dominated by their respective element. They exist at the very core of Athas, a roiling maelstrom of raw matter and energy caught in an eternal war to seize each other's dominions. The elements care little for the affairs of the mortal plane beyond the territory they claim there, their endless ambition a primeval force of creation at best, a ruinous hunger at worst.

The inner planes are connected to the Material Plane via cosmic conduits called vortices. Commonly known types of vortices are free-standing and temporary. A freestanding vortex to the Realm of Fire might be in the heart of a volcano, for instance. A temporary vortex is most often a spell, such as *plane shift*. Less commonly known or acknowledged are the living vortices, creatures of great power that serve as avatars for the elementals' war upon the mortal plane. Such beings are brought about only in times of great imbalance, as the vast power required can leave their host element vulnerable on its home plane.

Pieces of each prime element have been scattered throughout each others' planes, remnants of wars spanning back to the dawn of creation. These lost scraps take on qualities of their environs, developing into fusions of two or more elements called paraelementals. These creations can be seen in the Material Plane in forms such as lightning, magma, or silt. Summoned elemental spirits are called quasielementals,  finding form and consciousness through mortal hands. 



\column



### Realm of Earth
The Realm of Earth is a vast desert ridged on all sides by majestic mountains and jagged outcroppings of rock. The land is dotted with tunnels and caverns, and strange rock islands float lazily in place of clouds.

### Realm of Air
The Realm of Air is a vast, seemingly endless expanse of nothing - except air. Wispy clouds from the paraelemental plane of
steam sometimes float through here, and a traveler can leap from cloud to cloud, simply landing on another should they fall. The spirits that live here float on fierce breezes, or dwell in secret in the centers of the clouds.

### Realm of Fire
The Realm of Fire is a reddish land awash in labyrinthine
walls of flame. Great gouts of fire shoot randomly from the
crimson earth, and the shimmering heat gives everything a
hazy, hellish look. Far in the distance, the horizon seems
to be made of impassable fires the size of mountains.

### Realm of Water
The Realm of Water was once a pristine, infinite ocean, its crystal-clear waters rising to waves that could drown a world and descending to an abyss of unimaginable depths. A traveler could swim forever without fear of drowning, and witness coral reefs like painted mountains. Today, those reefs are but bleached bone, and the ocean has been drained to puddles of murky brine amid barren plains of silt. The spirits are few, and parched. None are friendly.

# Appendix B: The Sorcerer-Kings



What follows is the hidden lore of the Sorcerer Kings, much of which is known only to those who witnessed their rise and fall or serve within their domain. Such secrets are not only lost to time, they are forbidden-- for the rulers of the Tablelands, history is a tool and a weapon. With unfathomable power and eternal life came the ability to shape their own stories, and woe befall any who question their tale. 


\column

## The Champions of Rajaat
All Sorcerer-Kings share the same beginning, though their paths have split over the ages that came after. Once there was a being called Rajaat, the First Sorcerer. An ancient being obsessed with restoring the world to lost glory, he discovered the dark arts of defilement and spread them to fifteen of the greatest spellcasters of his age. 

With these Champions, Rajaat declared himself Emperor and waged a war of conquest upon all of Athas, scouring it of his enemies. In the end, there was only lifeless silt and deserts burning beneath a blackened sun. His reward was betrayal-- the Champions cast Rajaat into the Hollow, divvied up the little habitable land left as spoils of their massacres, and so claimed what are now the city-states of the Tablelands. With none to oppose them, the Champions declared dominion over all of Athas, becoming Sorcerer-Kings warring eternally amongst each other for the scraps of a dying world.

## Abalach-Re of Raam
Over the nearly thirty generations that she has ruled Raam, Abalach-Re has taken many mates and borne scores of children. She has little affection for her progeny, discarding them or keeping them depending on her mood. Those she abandons at birth are given to one of the noble nawab families and raised as foster children, while those kept become high-ranking functionaries or hidden agents scattered throughout Raam. In this way the city-state has become a nepotistic labyrinth of intertwined lineages, a puppet show of government dancing at Abalach-Re's fingers. 

Abalach-Re’s living descendants are known as the Offspring. Many manifest unusual magical or psionic talents; it is rumored that Abalach-Re manipulates her children with sorcerous energy before they are born, and that they pass their unpredictable gifts to their own children in turn. The citizens of Raam exchange whispered tales about the purpose behind the Offspring. Some say that Abalach-Re grows old and wishes to move her intellect into a younger version of herself. Others believe that she is preparing for a great ritual that requires the sacrifice of countless progeny from her  bloodline. Still others claim that she cannot die as long as at least one of her children remains alive.

Perhaps it is this superstition which stays the hand of outright rebellion-- for Raam, ancient and magnificent as it was, is now a pale shade of its wondrous heights. Centuries of plundering the countryside for its resources, rampant corruption in its government, and Abalach-Re's growing disinterest in governance have brought the city-state to the brink of disintegration.

The alabaster quarries and gemstone mines stand exhausted, and reckless agricultural practices have led to disastrous food shortages. In the streets, violent factions sworn to one warlord or another battle for control as the once-vibrant and influential city slips into ruin. Mobs riot daily against their ineffectual ruler, the sorcerer-queen Abalach-Re, and yet she looks only to plots which none can see the ends or beginnings of, captivated by ambitions whose scope has blinded her to the fires at her feet. 

\column

::

### Spies of the Sorcerer
Abalach-Re has comparatively few Templars. When she has need of new ones, she performs divinations to discover young citizens who might be suited for wielding magic. Then she removes the candidates from their families, regardless of caste, and trains them to serve her. The Templars take new names and exist outside the caste system, like their mistress, and serve as her eyes and ears within the nobility of Raam's nawab warlords and the intricate machinations of the Grand Vizier's administrative agents.

Disorder and strife have made it dangerous for Templars, many of whom now walk the streets only with armed escort or barricade themselves in their estates. Still others use the disarray to their advantage, hatching secret plots and forging perilous alliances.

## Andropinis of Balic
Balic is ruled by the Dictator Andropinis, a powerful Sorcerer-King who was elected to his post over seven hundred years ago. Though the term “dictator” originally referred to the power of dictating (as in stating) a city policy sanctioned by a democratic assembly of property owners, Andropinis has converted the title and office into one of total authority. Anyone who speaks against him is executed by dictatorial decree.

On the rare occasions that someone is brave enough to voice a complaint about the harshness of Andropinis' rule, the old man takes great delight in reminding all within earshot that their ancestors elected him to his post for life. Unfortunately for the citizens of Balic, nobody realized just how long Andropinis might live.

\column

::

### The Pulpit of Praetors
Praetors are the Templars of Balic. By popular vote, they are elected to their offices for 10-year terms. Once they have won their positions, Andropinis invests them with the magical power necessary to perform their duties. The dictator’s minions carefully screen candidates and arrange voting districts and slates to produce the results that Andropinis desires. On occasion, an unwanted praetor is elected despite the dictator’s arrangements; unfortunate accidents often befall such people shortly after they take office.

## Borys of Ur Draxa
Every being on Athas fears the Dragon, from the lowliest slaves to the mightiest Sorcerer-Kings. The legends say the Dragon swoops in periodically to demand tribute, claiming its tithe of slaves and treasure and taking them into the desert. It feels neither fear nor doubt, and it kills, steals, and destroys what it wants, when it wants.

The truth behind the Dragon is known only to the Sorcerer-Kings, for the Dragon was once one of them. Borys the Butcher was a student of Rajaat, the First Sorcerer; along with fourteen other secret students, he learned the power of defiling magic and became a Champion. When the Champions’ scouring wars ruined the world, though, Borys rebelled against his master and led the others against him. They defeated Rajaat and imprisoned him in the Hollow, outside time and space.

After the Champions resettled in the Tablelands, each claimed a city-state and began the magical metamorposis to become dragons, titans of power that could bend the world beneath their talons. Borys, demanding the power to guard Rajaat’s prison, enlisted the help of the others to complete the process first. The ritual required a sacrifice: it ripped the life from the lands once called Ebe, eradicating its citizens and fouling the lands into a hellish, volcanic wasteland. The Dragon then rechristened its city Ur Draxa, or the City of Doom.

The Dragon dwells in the palace of Ur Draxa, at the center of the Valley of Dust and Fire in the Sea of Silt. The people of Athas see the Dragon only when it collects its levy of souls from the other Sorcerer-Kings. It claims hundreds of slaves, which it devours or brings to Ur Draxa for use in experiments, as gifts to the liches that serve it, or in service to some secret, unspeakable agenda.

:

### The Draxan Dead Lords 
A circle of liches in the Dragon’s service, called the Dead Lords, governs the City of Doom. These undead creatures form a cabinet of ministers for Ur Draxa, attending to the mundane operations in which the Dragon has apparently lost interest. Each Dead Lord was once a powerful vizier, Templar, or warrior, rewarded for their cruelty and efficiency with the eternal undeath afforded a kaisharga. Several kaisharga dream of unseating the Dragon and taking its place, but not even all the kaisharga together could stand against the beast.

Beneath the cold hands of the Dead Lords are the living denizens of the city. There are three administrative arms: the Templars, the army, and the viziers. Postings to the government are considered the highest honor for the Draxan citizen; clans engage in fierce feuds to determine who may enroll a son or daughter in the ranks of the Templars, or gain a favorable assignment in the army.

## Daskinor of Eldaarich
Paranoid, given to fantastic delusions, and gripped by fear, Daskinor is as dangerous as he is mad. The seeds of his insanity were present long ago, but it has grown in intensity over the centuries so that now, his terror is broken only by random outrage and accusations. Daskinor’s diseased mind invents enemies where none exist, and they change all the time. Some new threat swims up through his mind’s fog, and once he puts a name to it, he expends every resource at his disposal to destroy it. 

His recent targets include the Veiled Alliance, the tanning industry, three clueless slaves, nobles, Templars, Aarakocra, colors, and whatever else catches his attention in a negative way. Daskinor does experience fleeting periods of lucidity, or at least, when he is less dangerous to others than he normally is-- but they are rare. 

The years weigh heavily on the Sorcerer-King. Daskinor hoards everything in the belief that his enemies can use anything he discards against him. He never cuts his hair or fingernails, and he never bathes out of fear that an assassin might extract some essence from the wash and render it into a poison that can kill even a being of his power.

Currently, Daskinor frets most about those who possess psionic power. His Templars scour the city for anyone displaying talent with the Way, and those discovered are executed with no recourse. That Daskinor also has great psionic power is not lost on the Sorcerer-King and, in darker moments, he suspects even himself of evil plotting; thus, he permits no mirrors in his quarters, lest he catch himself in his own gaze and fall prey to an attack from his subconscious.

\column

::

### Prisoners to Paranoia 
Eldaarich's fortified walls and barred gates protect Daskinor, but they do nothing to shield those within from the Sorcerer-King himself. His chaos has infected the city, and fear of becoming his next target is the only thing keeping its people from outright anarchy. Instead, the Templars and nobles practice the more subdued art of betrayal and assassination--to gain power, misdirect suspicion, or simply to ease the tension of their precarious lives.

## Dregoth of Giustenal
In life, Dregoth was on the verge of achieving the final stage of metamorphosis, eclipsing all but the already ascendant Dragon. Unlike the other Sorcerer-Kings, Dregoth proudly displayed the scaly skin and elongated skull of his ensuing metamorphosis, flaunting the power he had accumulated without the aid of any ally. The eleven remaining Sorcerer-Kings grew concerned, especially at the thought of having another mad Dragon to deal with.

Abalach-Re of Raam was the closest to Giustenal and perhaps felt the most threatened. She contacted the other kings and joined with them in a dark conspiracy. Their plan was as ruthless and direct as their rule had ever been. They would teleport into Dregoth’s city and slay him on his ivory throne. It was to be done with little fanfare and with sudden efficiency. Dregoth was slain along with thousands of bystanders. They leveled Giustenal in their fury, burying the would-be dragon beneath the ruins of his own shattered palace.

This was not the end for Dregoth, however. Over the years, Dregoth had searched for a way to achieve true godhood – not just the simulated godhood provided by Rajaat’s teachings. His experiments resulted in a magical process for prolonging life beyond death. Dregoth’s obsession led him to believe that this was a means to achieving godhood. In truth, Dregoth had discovered the process for becoming a kaisharga, a lichlike creature of eternal undeath. 

The undead Sorcerer-King rose in his new form in time to gather what was left of his Templars and followers from the wilderness. He took them into the ancient ruins beneath his once-mighty city far from the eyes of his enemies. Here, Dregoth built a new Giustenal. He forged a new race of followers. And he continued his quest to become a god.

Now, after all these centuries, Dregoth is ready to return to the surface world. He is ready to take his rightful place as ruler of all Athas.

\column

:

### The Dread King's Army
Over a tenth of New Giustenal's populace are full Templars of Dregoth, so marked by a thick, yellowish scale that rises from the Dray's spine upon receiving Dregoth's blessing. Beyond these exalted champions, the entire populace of New Giustenal is also expected to take up arms in Dregoth's grand crusade of the Tablelands once word is given.

## Hamanu of Urik
Hamanu, Lion of the Desert, Savior of Urik,  boasts with good reason. Urik is a powerful city-state with teeming armies, enormous walls, bustling commerce, and wise sages, governed in an orderly framework established by the self-styled King of the World. Urik’s legions have never met defeat, and Hamanu has never run from battle. Thus, any decision of importance made in the Tyr Region must consider the wishes of Urik’s Sorcerer-King. 

Urik displays a face of meritocracy, but hidden webs of patronage and influence secure important posts and stations for people with the right connections, and it is every bit as oppressive as any other city-state – perhaps more so, thanks to the number and efficiency of Hamanu’s templars.

Hamanu appears before his subjects as a Leonin of mythic proportions, ever clad in armor of such filigreed alloys that it dazzles the eye to look upon. His thick, flowing mane winds into braided chains bound with rings of gold and platinum, and songs have been sung of enemies felled by little more than his heartless yellow gaze. 

### The Urikite Lions
Urikite Templars are recruited exclusively from the city's vast Leonin population, enjoying all the great power of status but stripped of the luxury which otherwise satiates Urik's masses. Hamanu sees them as extensions of his will and presence. It is nothing to him to sacrifice a templar, and he discards them as he would slaves or pieces upon a dragon-chess board. 

Templars fulfill many functions in the city-state: enforcing laws, collecting taxes, overseeing slaves, leading warriors in battle, and ferreting out enemies of the state. They wear cloaks or capes of royal purple as their badge of office; no one else is permitted to wear similar garments. Although low-ranking Templars live under military discipline, high-ranking Templars are awarded noble titles and rich estates as signs of Hamanu’s favor.

## Kalak of Tyr
Tyr is ruled by the Sorcerer-King Kalak, a pragmatic and ruthless man. Kalak is perhaps the most honest of all Sorcerer-Kings. He rules by the might of his magic and tremendous psionic powers, placing his own security and the stability of Tyr above all other considerations. Some call him the Tyrant of Tyr for this, but none could say he hid the burdens of state behind artifice. 

For the past twenty years, he has diverted much of the city’s slave labor to building a mighty ziggurat, claiming that it would protect Tyr from attacks by the Dragon. At first, the nobles were tolerant of his folly, for the burden it placed on them was not great. Over the last year, however, Kalak has grown frantic to finish the massive structure, appropriating so many slaves that there is almost nobody left to work the fields.

Kalak has also taken the slaves out of the mines, completely shutting down iron production. This has caused the city’s economy to crash, leaving merchant and noble alike destitute. The slaves starve, and even free craftsmen receive only meager rations in return for their services - and then only if they worked on the ziggurat.

\column

:

### Tithian and his Templars
The Templars of Tyr are in many ways a model for all the Tablelands, with discrete Bureaus for each of their many functions; a Bureau of Fields to ensure the city eats, a Bureau of Public Works to organize the city's maintenance, and so on. 

Overseeing it all is the High Templar Tithian, a powerful psion and son of old nobility. Though he enjoys the prestige of Kalak's favor, some within the Templars eye him warily. They whisper of his plans for a Tyrian Council, formed of the citizenry, ruling the city-state beside their peers. Kalak's place in such a notion is ominously absent. 

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/dB5YMSv/Kalak.jpg' style='position:relative; top:205px; left:-690px; height:800px; width:780px;mix-blend-mode:multiply' >

## Kalid-Ma of Kalidnay
Kalidnay was once a great power in the Tablelands. That changed centuries ago when a force unknown to the other Sorcerer-Kings abruptly destroyed the city-state, leaving its citizens slain and its Sorcerer-King, Kalid-Ma, missing. To outside observers, one day Kalidnay was a vibrant city; the next, it was an empty shell bereft of life.

Kalid-Ma ruled his city and its domains with iron authority, as other Sorcerer-Kings do. His greatest lieutenant was the High Templar Thakok-An, who was a ruthless master of the Way and a fearsome Arcanist, perhaps the greatest mortal power of her age. During the days of Kalid-Ma’s rule, Kalidnay was among the wealthiest of the city-states, and Kalid-Ma was a formidable defiler who inspired dread in his rivals.

Despite Kalidnay’s prominence, Kalid-Ma was unsatisfied. He sought the ultimate defiler’s apotheosis – transformation into a dragon. Kalid-Ma’s metamorphosis progressed too slowly for the impatient monarch. He began
supplementing the process with spells of his own creation.

The other Sorcerer-Kings learned of Kalid-Ma’s plans. They plotted to attack Kalidnay and slay Kalid-Ma while he was weak from his ritual-working and before he could complete his change. Thakok-An learned of this plot, and seeking to be the hero, she chose to act in her king’s defense rather than inform him of the scheme against him. Kalid-Ma’s greatest spells were inscribed in texts that Thakok-An could access, and she began searching the Sorcerer-King’s knowledge for a way to aid him. She found what she was looking for.

One night during Kalid-Ma’s ascension ritual, Thakok-An led her family to the top of the great ziggurat in the heart of Kalidnay, inside which Kalid-Ma was performing his rite. There, Thakok-An began working magic with her newfound skills, slaughtering her relatives to provide the energy needed for her mighty spells. She believed her family’s blood would strengthen Kalid-Ma’s ritual and hasten his change. Thakok-An’s pride led to her fall as much as her cruelty did. Her understanding of her ritual was tragically incomplete. At the conclusion of her ceremony, a great fissure sundered the ziggurat. Powerful defiling magic from Kalid-Ma's own rituial began to flow through the streets of Kalidnay, killing uncounted numbers of citizens instantly. 

The scant few records of the ensuing disaster tell of a mighty Dragon sweeping out of the broken city, laying waste to all in its path. Unlike the Dragon of Ur Draxa, this immense creature seemed to be made partially of living shadow, a being of darkness and defiling magic that flew right out of nightmare.

This Dragon was, in fact, the spirit of Kalid-Ma, torn from his body and twisted into a terrifying abomination. For weeks, he rampaged across his lands
until Kalak of Tyr, Hamanu of Urik, and the Dragon of Ur Draxa
combined forces to slay him.

### The Shadowed City



However, unknown to the Sorcerer-Kings, Kalid-Ma was not fully defeated. Since Kalid-Ma’s physical body had been dragged into the Gray, the death of his dragon form failed to put an end to his existence. After being slain by the other Sorcerer-Kings, the shattered spirit of Kalid-Ma found shelter in five obsidian orbs prepared with powerful enchantments for just so dire an end. Kalidnay too persists within the Gray, sentenced to eternal exile unless the Orbs of Kalid-Ma are reunited in the Material Plane. Only then can Kalid-Ma wake and return his lost city to Athas.

## Lalali-Puy of Gulg
The Sorcerer-King of Gulg, Lalali-Puy, is called the oba by her subjects. The oba is an absolute monarch whose name means ‘forest goddess’ in the language of her people. This is not a title she assumed herself, but one that her subjects thrust upon her. Lalali-Puy can command anything she wishes and knows that she will be instantly obeyed by her people. In their eyes, she is a goddess: they attribute her long life to immortality, and they believe that only a being of supreme power could have the abilities that she displays.

Lalali-Puy is perhaps the only city ruler who enjoys the popular support of her subjects. Gulg is engaged in an ages-old territorial war with Nibenay, the city at the other end of the forest. As terrible as their oba is, the inhabitants of Gulg are convinced that she is all that stands between them and being totally enslaved by Nibenay. In this, they are undoubtedly correct.
 
 
Lalali-Puy has worked for centuries to cultivate a stable and loyal populace, and her influence can be felt in all aspects of Gulg life. She has made a tremendous effort to elevate the hunter-gatherer culture and denigrate the mercantile life and other forces of change. The leafy crown of the her palace, built amid the branches of an enormous agafari tree, can be seen from virtually any point in the city. Any citizen of Gulg can approach the oba to beg audience, though not all escape with their lives.   

The mythology of her relationship to the people, and the culture she has fostered, requires that she protect the forest and its surrounds. This is not motivated out of any ardent love of nature, but simply  keen political intellect. Do not think for a minute that Lalali-Puy does not train scores of defilers, or that she would think twice about laying waste to the entire forest if it would advance her long-term goals.

### The Oba's Servants
The Templars of Gulg are as different from those of other city-states as possible. They are much more shamanistic and use their Oba's power to bind spirits to their will. They are instantly recognizable by the tight-bound necklaces they wear, accumulating more with rank until their necks are covered and elongated by thick collars of beads and teeth. The Templars keep to themselves and seldom walk among the public. Instead they use the night to their advantage to enact the will of the Oba.

## Nibenay of Nibenay

The city of Nibenay is named after its founder, the Sorcerer-King Nibenay. Called the Shadow King by his subjects, Nibenay is a bizarre and enigmatic figure. His subjects see him so rarely that the city is constantly filled with rumors that he has died. If ever these rumors result in a civil disturbance, however, Nibenay appears long enough to impress upon his subjects that he is still very much alive--usually by singlehandedly crushing the rebellion.

The Shadow King lives inside a walled sub-city located in the center of Nibenay. No free man has ever seen his palace in person, but according to rumor it sits atop an artificial mountain of stone slabs. The palace itself is supposedly a giant bust of Nibenay’s head. The front of the castle is carved into a stone relief of the Shadow King’s face. The sides and rear of the palace are covered with life-sized representations of dancing women, strung together as if they were locks of his hair.

### The Shadow-Consorts
All of the Shadow King's Templars are bound to him in a marriage pact, and thus call themselves his Shadow-Consorts. Whether this was a custom begun to ensure loyalty among his priesthood or simply a result of his insatiable appetites is unclear. Regardless, they are  perhaps the second most efficient and disciplined Templars in the Tablelands, after Hamanu's legions in Urik. Nibenay is a great believer in systems, and has defined a strict autocratic system which places virtually every aspect of city management in the hands of his subordinates, becoming involved only in times of great crisis.

## Oronis of Kurn
Oronis the Avangion guides the paths of the twin cities of Kurn. Oronis spent centuries redeeming himself, going so far as to change his very nature from evil to good, though he still feels he has a long way to go to make up for his acts as a Champion of Rajaat and a Sorcerer-King. For this reason, he has dedicated himself and his citizens to working toward the eventual restoration of all Athas.

While in Old Kurn, Oronis wears the guise of a Sorcerer-King, an able-bodied if lanky human with a close-shorn golden beard and bald head crowned with a gold-and-obsidian circlet. In the secret city of New Kurn, however, such disguises aren’t called for. There he openly displays his true avangion form – a tall, thin, hairless humanoid with silver skin, rootlike anatomy, and gossamer wings.

### The Vigilants of Kurn
Within Old Kurn, Templars exist for a two-fold purpose-- to present a thin veneer of normalcy in Old Kurn, lest the other city-states catch on to Oronis' grander ambitions, and to keep a close eye on the populace for any signs of defilement. They style themselves as Vigilants, named for the watch they keep, and spare no mercy for those who would threaten  Kurn. 

In New Kurn, the Vigilants exist as an order of experimental preservers, working to restore the city's hidden valley and devise a method by which Athas itself might one day be reborn. There is little need for peacekeeping or bureaucratic oppression there, and so the Vigilants are free to dedicate themselves fully to their dreams of a green dawn.

## Sielba of Yaramuke
Long ago, Yaramuke was the fourth city-state along the Road of Kings, Raam’s nearest neighbor and occasional ally. Yaramuke’s Sorcerer-King Sielba doomed her people when she reached too far. Sielba had long coveted the obsidian of the Smoking Crown mountains, so she sent prospectors into enemy territory to establish new quarries. When Hamanu of Urik discovered Yaramite miners in his mountains, he rounded them up and sent their heads back to Sielba, their teeth replaced with jagged chunks of obsidian as a warning against further encroachments.

Incensed, Sielba sent an army of slave warriors to take the mines by force, but the legions of Hamanu’s Urikite Lions crushed them easily. Since it was clear that Sielba hadn’t understood his warning, Hamanu chose to strike back. He led a small army up the Road of Kings, moving at a slow, easy march as a sign of his disdain for his opponent. When his army arrived a month later, he found Yaramuke well defended, its walls protected by thousands of warriors promised citizenship should they live to see victory.

The Urikite legions surrounded the city but did not attack. Instead, Hamanu climbed to the highest hill overlooking the city and began a terrible incantation. So powerful was this ritual, so destructive its force, that Hamanu drew the life from all the plants and animals for miles around. His magic scoured the farmlands to ash, shattered the city’s walls, killed its defenders, and swept through the streets, slaying thousands of noncombatants in a rain of fiery death. Not even the Urikite army was spared, and many of Hamanu’s soldiers fell in agony  as they held Yaramuke's forces within range of Hamanu's wrath. By the time the magic had run its course, the city was reduced to rubble, and the lands around were poisoned, defiled, and ruined for all time.

Although Yaramuke was destroyed, the city-state was never sacked, and some believe that it still contains secrets and riches. The promise of Sielba’s vast wealth is enough for many adventurers to set aside common sense and plunge headlong into the devastated city. Others strike the city from their maps, believing the entire region a cursed place best forgotten to the bloody annals of Athasian history.

## Tectuktitlay of Draj
According to the story told by the moon priests of Draj, the moons Ral and Guthay pitied the world and gave to it their son, a god in mortal flesh named Tectuktitlay. The god led his chosen people out of suffering and to a new home. With a word, he repaired the lands, turning sand to soil and bringing forth lush growth. 

With a sweep of his hand, he raised a city to give shelter to his followers. His work complete, Tectuktitlay made ready to depart, but the mortals beseeched him to stay and protect them from jealous enemies who would claim his gift for themselves. The Father of Life consented, and the people built for him a palace in which he would dwell forever.

Actually, Tectuktitlay is no god. He’s “merely” a Sorcerer-King, and a middling one at that. He is petty, spiteful, and ravenous for power above his station. Never content with his holdings, he constantly looks to the west, probing his rivals’ lands and defenses for weakness so he can send forth his legions and expand his empire.

### The Moon Priests
Draj’s Templars are known as moon priests. Part bureaucrats, part warriors, and part religious police, they use fear and propaganda to ensure Tectuktitlay’s continued reign. Their primary purpose is to control the population and observe a bewildering variety of rites and celebrations throughout the year. The moon priests teach the Draji that bountiful harvests will continue only as long as Tectuktitlay and the moons are pleased.

# Dark Sun Campaign Setting

Amid the barren wastelands of Athas lie the scattered city states, each in the grip of its own, tyrannical Sorcerer-King. Protecting their own positions with dark magic, they demand absolute obedience. The restless mobs are placated with bread and circuses - the arenas overflow with spectators seeking release from their harsh lives.

The land outside the cities belongs to no one. Merciless and cunning Elvhen sprint across the deserts, ever fleeing the insectoid Thri-kreen seeking to satisfy their taste for blood. Dwarves labor endlessly at projects beyond the scope of men while the world crumbles around them, feral Seedlings prey upon any intruders, the despondent children of giants and elementals roam as Tareks and Ukoven, and Humans chafe at the chains of slavery's atrocities even as they mutate into a new species of psionic beings. 

Athas is a land of deadly magic and powerful psionics that offers no promise of glory or even of survival. Those who do not have the strength and cunning to face life on Athas will surely perish, leaving nothing but bones bleached white under the blistering rays of the Dark Sun.
